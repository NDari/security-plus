# CompTIA Security+ SY0-601

This is just a WIP, the final version of these materials will be found on my [blog](https://binaricoders.dev). These are just the drafts for the different articles.

This repository is not going to be a coding repository. The purpose of this repository is to store my notes about the 'CompTIA Security+ SY0-601' learning and study.

The reason to use this format instead of the usual blog format, [Binary Coders]((https://binaricoders.dev)), is that
this is going to be a live project, I wanted to be free to edit, change or redo the different sections and be able to
write this in a non-linear way. Be able to review things and add new information to the sections already finished.

I hope, if you have landed here, this document can be of any use to you.

To experiment with recent developments in generative language models based on the 'transformer' architecture, instead of writing all the content myself as I did for previous series related to *InfoSec* certification (i.e., [CEH](https://binarycoders.dev/2020/06/07/ceh-i-preamble-and-index/)), I am going to execute the following steps:

- [x] Generate the content using ChatGPT, and a few manual modifications based on common sense or obvious missing content.
- [ ] Answer a collection of exam questions using solely the generated content.
- [ ] Edit and modify the content to add any extra information missing based on the reviewed questions.
- [ ] Continue the reviewing process till a satisfaying number of questions can be answered solely based on these notes.

Why doing it in this way?

- First, because I think is a more fun way to study the CompTIA Security+ SY0-601 material than just trying to brute-force memorise them.
- Second, becasue I am curious about how to work with generative language models, and how to interact with them to improve performance. And, I think that having a goal and trying to achieve it can help me to improve my skills interacting with such a models.
- Finally, becasue... let's see what happens. Is it possible that this needs to be re-written manually as I did for the CEH contents? yes. Is is possible with the help of the generative language model I can finish a taskthat it will take me a few months in a few weeks? Yes. Is it possible the generated content needs no review? Yes. And, this is why this is the final reason, just pure curiosity.
