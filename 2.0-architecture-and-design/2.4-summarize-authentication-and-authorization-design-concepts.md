# 2.4 Summarize authentication and authorization design concepts

## Authentication methods

Authentication methods **are used to verify the identity of a user or entity**. There are various authentication methods, and some of them are:

1.  **Directory services**: It is a centralized database that stores user credentials, such as usernames and passwords. It provides a way to authenticate users across multiple applications and services.
2.  **Federation**: It is a method of authentication that allows a user to authenticate with a third-party identity provider. The identity provider is responsible for verifying the user's identity and providing authentication tokens that can be used to access the requested resource.
3.  **Attestation**: It is a method of authentication that uses a trusted third-party to verify the identity of a user or device. It involves providing proof of identity, such as a certificate or digital signature.
4.  **Smart card authentication**: It is a method of authentication that uses a smart card to store user credentials. The smart card is inserted into a card reader, and the user provides a PIN to authenticate themselves.

These are some additional technologies related to authentication methods:

- **Time-based one-time password (TOTP)**: TOTP is a type of two-factor authentication that generates a temporary password based on the current time and a shared secret key. The password is typically valid for a short period of time (e.g., 30 seconds) and is used in combination with a user's regular password to provide an additional layer of security.
- **HMAC-based one-time password (HOTP)**: HOTP is similar to TOTP, but instead of using the current time, it uses a counter value to generate the temporary password. This can be useful in situations where the clock on a user's device is not synchronized with the server.
- **Short message service (SMS)**: SMS authentication involves sending a temporary code to a user's mobile phone via text message. The user must enter the code to complete the authentication process. While SMS authentication is convenient, it is also vulnerable to attacks such as SIM swapping.
- **Token key**: A token key is a physical device that generates a one-time password or other type of authentication code. Token keys can be either hardware-based (e.g., a USB token) or software-based (e.g., an app on a user's phone).
- **Static codes**: Static codes are pre-generated codes that can be used for authentication. They are typically printed on a card or other physical medium and given to the user.
- **Authentication applications**: Authentication applications are software applications that generate one-time passwords or other types of authentication codes. They can be installed on a user's computer or mobile device.
- **Push notifications**: Push notifications involve sending a notification to a user's device asking them to approve or deny an authentication request. This can be a more user-friendly alternative to entering a password or authentication code.
- **Phone call**: Phone call authentication involves calling a user's phone and asking them to enter a PIN or other authentication code. This method can be useful in situations where a user does not have access to their mobile device or computer.

Other common authentication methods include username and password, biometric authentication (such as fingerprint or facial recognition), and multi-factor authentication (MFA).

## Biometrics

Biometrics **is the measurement and analysis of unique physical and behavioral characteristics of an individual to confirm their identity**. It involves the use of advanced technology to collect and analyze data on physical features such as fingerprints, facial recognition, voice recognition, iris scans, and even DNA. Biometric authentication is often used as a secure method of identity verification for access to sensitive information or physical locations, replacing traditional passwords or PINs. It provides a higher level of security and convenience for users, as they do not need to remember complex passwords or carry identification cards.

Some common types of biometric authentication include fingerprint, retina, iris, facial, voice, vein, and gait analysis.

-   **Fingerprint**: This type of biometric authentication is based on the unique patterns of ridges and furrows on an individual's fingers. It is one of the oldest and most commonly used forms of biometric authentication.
-   **Retina**: Retinal biometrics is based on the unique patterns of blood vessels at the back of the eye. It requires a specialized scanner that emits a low-intensity light into the eye and captures the reflection from the retina.
-   **Iris**: Iris biometrics is similar to retinal biometrics but instead focuses on the unique patterns in the colored part of the eye. It also requires a specialized scanner to capture the image of the iris.
-   **Facial**: Facial biometrics uses an individual's unique facial features to verify their identity. It involves capturing an image or video of the face and using algorithms to analyze and compare it with stored templates.
-   **Voice**: Voice biometrics involves capturing an individual's unique vocal patterns and using them to verify their identity. It can be used to authenticate individuals over the phone or in person.
-   **Vein**: Vein biometrics is based on the unique patterns of blood vessels beneath an individual's skin. It requires a specialized scanner that uses near-infrared light to capture the vein patterns.
-   **Gait analysis**: Gait analysis biometrics uses an individual's unique walking pattern to verify their identity. It involves capturing video footage of the individual's gait and using algorithms to analyze and compare it with stored templates.    

The efficacy rates of biometric authentication vary depending on the type of biometric and the quality of the data captured. **False acceptance refers to when an unauthorized user is mistakenly granted access**, while **false rejection refers to when an authorized user is mistakenly denied access**. The crossover error rate is the point at which the false acceptance and false rejection rates are equal, and it is used to measure the overall accuracy of a biometric system.

## Multifactor authentication (MFA) factors and attributes

Multifactor authentication (MFA) **is a security system that requires users to provide two or more forms of identification in order to access a system, application, or device**. The goal of MFA is to provide an additional layer of security beyond a simple username and password combination. By requiring multiple forms of identification, MFA can greatly reduce the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive data or systems.

### Factors

There are three authentication factors used in computing:

- **Something you know**: The knowledge factor relates to something you know, typically used when you identify yourself to a system with a user name and password combination.
- **Something you have**: The possession factor relates to something you have. You physically possess an object to use as an authenticator.
- **Something you are**: The inherence factor relates to something you are, relying on a personâ€™s unique physical characteristics that can be used as a form of identification, such as fingerprints, retinal eye patterns, iris patterns, handprints, and voiceprints.

### Attributes

There are four common attributes:

- **Something you do**: Something you do, meaning that when you present your credentials to the system, you must perform an action, is a common attribute that accompanies authentication factors, such as a hand gesture on a smartphone.
- **Somewhere you are**: The location attribute relates to your location when you authenticate. This attribute could use either physical or logical locations and requires you to be in a certain location when you authenticate to the system, such as, in a highly secure facility, you may need to use a specific workstation.
- **Something you exhibit**: Something you exhibit can refer to something neurological that can be measured or scanned; it could be a personality trait or a mannerism , such as speech analysis systems.
- **Someone you know**: The someone you know attribute reflects a trust relationship, such as someone vouching for a third person.

## Authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA)

Authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) **are three security-related components commonly used to provide secure access to network resources**. These components are used in various network security applications, including remote access VPNs, wireless networks, and Network Access Control (NAC) solutions.

**Authentication refers to the process of verifying the identity of a user, device, or system**. The goal of authentication is to ensure that the person or system attempting to access a resource is who they claim to be. Authentication is typically accomplished using one or more factors, such as a username and password, a security token, or biometric data.

**Authorization refers to the process of granting or denying access to a particular resource based on the authenticated user's privileges**. Authorization is often referred to as access control, and it is used to enforce security policies and ensure that users can only access the resources they are authorized to use.

**Accounting refers to the process of tracking and recording user activity and resource usage. This information is used for security auditing**, billing, and analysis purposes. Accounting data may include information such as who accessed a resource, when it was accessed, and how long it was accessed.

Together, authentication, authorization, and accounting provide a comprehensive security framework for controlling access to network resources and ensuring that users are held accountable for their actions.

## Cloud vs. on-premises requirements

Authentication requirements can vary between cloud and on-premises environments due to differences in the way they are accessed and managed.

In an on-premises environment, authentication can be managed through local user accounts and directories, such as Microsoft Active Directory, and user authentication is typically performed on the organization's own servers. This can provide greater control and customization of authentication policies and user access to resources, but it also requires the organization to manage and maintain their own authentication infrastructure.

In a cloud environment, authentication is typically managed by the cloud service provider, with users accessing resources through the provider's authentication systems. This can provide convenience and scalability, but also requires a certain level of trust in the provider's security practices and authentication mechanisms.

Regardless of the environment, authentication should include strong password policies, multi-factor authentication, and secure communication protocols to protect against unauthorized access. Additionally, authorization and accounting mechanisms should be in place to ensure that only authorized users are accessing resources and to track access and usage for auditing and compliance purposes.
