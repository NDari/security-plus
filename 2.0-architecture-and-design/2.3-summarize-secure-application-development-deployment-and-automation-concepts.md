# 2.3 Summarize secure application development, deployment, and automation concepts

## Environment

In software development, an environment **refers to the infrastructure or platform on which applications are developed, tested, deployed, and operated**. There are different types of environments that correspond to different stages of the software development lifecycle. These include:

1.  **Development environment**: This is where developers write and test code before it is ready for release to other environments. The development environment is typically isolated from other environments, and developers may have administrative privileges to install software and configure settings as needed.
2.  **Test environment**: This is where code is tested to ensure that it works as expected and is free from bugs and errors. The test environment is usually a replica of the production environment, but with less data and traffic. Testers may have limited access to configure settings in the test environment.
3.  **Staging environment**: This is where code is deployed to simulate the production environment as closely as possible. It is used to test the code in a real-world setting before releasing it to the production environment. The staging environment is typically isolated from the production environment and may have limited access to data.
4.  **Production environment**: This is the live environment where the application is used by end-users. The production environment is critical to the success of the application and requires the highest level of security, stability, and performance. Developers typically have limited access to the production environment to ensure that it is not accidentally altered or compromised.
5.  **Quality assurance (QA) environment**: This is a specialized environment that focuses on testing the quality of the application. It is typically used for manual and automated testing to ensure that the application meets the quality standards before being released to the production environment. The QA environment is usually a replica of the production environment with limited data and traffic.

## Provisioning and deprovisioning

**Provisioning refers to the process of setting up and configuring computing resources** such as servers, virtual machines, storage, and networking infrastructure to make them available for use. This includes activities such as creating user accounts, configuring access permissions, and installing necessary software.

**Deprovisioning**, on the other hand, **refers to the process of removing access rights, user accounts, and computing resources** that are no longer needed or have been decommissioned. This process is crucial for security and compliance purposes to ensure that access to sensitive data or resources is revoked when no longer required.

## Integrity measurement

Integrity measurement **is a process of verifying the integrity of a system or application by measuring and comparing the current state with a known good state**. This is done to detect any unauthorized changes or modifications that may have been made to the system or application. Integrity measurement can be performed using various techniques, including cryptographic hashing, digital signatures, and trusted platform modules (TPMs).

In essence, integrity measurement involves creating a baseline of the system or application's "*normal*" state, and then periodically checking to see if there have been any changes that deviate from this baseline. This can help detect and prevent security breaches and other unauthorized activities.

## Secure coding techniques

Secure coding techniques **refer to the practices and methods used to develop and maintain secure software applications**. Here are some common techniques used:

- **Normalization**: This technique involves ensuring that data stored in a database is consistent and conforms to certain rules, reducing the chances of SQL injection attacks.
- **Stored procedures**: This involves using pre-written procedures to execute database operations, reducing the chances of injection attacks.
- **Obfuscation/camouflage**: This technique involves disguising code to make it harder for attackers to understand and reverse-engineer.
- **Code reuse/dead code**: Unused code or code that is no longer required should be removed, as it can introduce security vulnerabilities.
- **Server-side vs. client-side execution and validation**: Server-side execution and validation is more secure than client-side, as it reduces the chances of tampering and injection attacks.
- **Memory management**: Proper memory management techniques should be used to prevent buffer overflow and other memory-related vulnerabilities.
- **Use of third-party libraries and software development kits (SDKs**): Third-party code should be vetted and kept up-to-date to reduce the chances of vulnerabilities.
- **Data exposure**: Sensitive data should be encrypted both in transit and at rest to reduce the chances of data exposure.

## Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)

The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) **is a nonprofit foundation focused on improving software security through open-source projects, resources, and tools**. OWASP provides guidance, checklists, and best practices to help organizations build secure web applications and APIs. They also publish a list of the top 10 most critical web application security risks, which is updated periodically to reflect new threats and trends in the industry. Additionally, OWASP hosts community events, training sessions, and conferences to promote awareness and education on software security issues.

## Software diversity

Software diversity **refers to the use of different software implementations for a particular task or function**. The idea behind software diversity is that using different implementations can make it harder for attackers to find and exploit vulnerabilities that exist in a specific implementation.

**A compiler is a program that translates source code written in a programming language into machine-readable code** that can be executed by a computer. **A binary**, on the other hand, **is the output of the compilation process and contains executable code** that can be run on a specific hardware architecture. In the context of software diversity, having different compilers or different versions of the same compiler can help to create diverse binaries that are less likely to share vulnerabilities with each other.

## Automation/scripting

Automation and scripting are essential components of secure application development and deployment processes. **Automation refers to the use of tools and processes that can be executed automatically**, without requiring human intervention, to perform tasks such as testing, deployment, and configuration management. **Scripting involves the creation of scripts or code that automate repetitive tasks and processes**.

Some areas or practices in software development associated to automation are:

- **Automated courses**: Automated courses of action are preconfigured responses to security incidents that can be triggered automatically.
- **Continuous monitoring**: Continuous monitoring involves the use of tools and techniques to monitor systems and applications for potential security issues in real-time.
- **Continuous validation**: Continuous validation involves the use of automated tools and techniques to test and validate the security of applications and systems on an ongoing basis.
- **Continuous integration**: Continuous integration is a software development practice where developers frequently merge their code changes into a central repository.
- **Continuous delivery**: Continuous delivery is the process of automatically deploying changes to a staging or production environment, and continuous deployment is the process of automatically deploying changes directly to production.

Overall, automation and scripting can help improve the speed, efficiency, and accuracy of secure application development and deployment processes, while also helping to reduce the risk of human error and security vulnerabilities.

## Elasticity

Elasticity **refers to the ability of a system to automatically scale its resources up or down based on demand**. This means that when the demand for a system increases, more resources are allocated to it, and when the demand decreases, resources are automatically released. Elasticity is an important characteristic of cloud computing environments, where resources are typically provisioned dynamically and charged on a usage-based model. Elasticity enables organizations to achieve optimal resource utilization, reduce costs, and ensure that systems can handle peak loads without degradation in performance.

## Scalability

Scalability **refers to the ability of an application or system to handle an increasing amount of work or traffic without experiencing performance degradation or downtime**. This can be achieved through various techniques, such as adding more resources, optimizing the code, or redesigning the architecture.

Scalability is essential in modern software development as it allows applications and systems to grow and adapt to changing demands and user needs. A scalable system should be able to handle an increasing number of users, requests, and data without any significant impact on performance, reliability, or security. It is typically measured in terms of vertical scalability, which involves adding more resources to a single machine, or horizontal scalability, which involves adding more machines to distribute the workload.

## Version control

Version control **is a system that helps developers keep track of changes made to their code over time**. It allows multiple developers to collaborate on the same codebase, track changes, and roll back to previous versions if necessary.

There are two types of version control systems: centralized and distributed. In a centralized system, there is a single repository that stores all code changes, and developers check out and check in code to the repository. In a distributed system, each developer has a copy of the repository on their local machine, and changes are synced between repositories.
