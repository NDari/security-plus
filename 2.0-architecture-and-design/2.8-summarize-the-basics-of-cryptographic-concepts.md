# 2.8 Summarize the basics of cryptographic concepts

## Digital signatures

A digital signature **is a cryptographic technique that provides authentication, integrity, and non-repudiation of electronic documents or messages**. It involves the use of a mathematical algorithm to create a unique digital fingerprint of the document or message, which can then be verified by the recipient to ensure that the document or message has not been altered and was indeed sent by the claimed sender.

## Key length

Key length **refers to the size of the key used in cryptographic algorithms**. In symmetric-key cryptography, it is the length of the secret key used for encryption and decryption, while in public-key cryptography, it is the length of the public and private keys used for digital signatures and encryption. The longer the key length, the more secure the encryption, as longer keys are more difficult to crack using brute-force attacks or other cryptographic attacks.

## Key stretching

Key stretching **is a technique used to make a cryptographic key stronger and more secure by adding complexity to the key derivation process, typically by using a slow hash function or a series of hash functions**. The goal is to increase the difficulty of brute-force attacks against the key.

## Salting

Salting **is the process of adding a random sequence of data to the input data before the data is hashed in order to make it more difficult for attackers to crack the hash**. This technique is commonly used in password storage to enhance security by making it harder to use precomputed hash tables or dictionary attacks.

## Hashing

Hashing **is the process of converting any arbitrary size data into a fixed-size string of characters or bytes, which is unique to that data**. The hash function takes the input (message or data) and produces the hash value, which can be used to verify the integrity of the data or to uniquely identify it.

## Key exchange

Key exchange **is a process of securely sharing cryptographic keys between two parties over an insecure channel**, such as the internet, to establish a secure communication channel between them. This process enables the parties to communicate securely without revealing the keys to an eavesdropper or attacker. Key exchange protocols are used in various applications, including secure web browsing, email encryption, and virtual private networks (VPNs).

## Elliptic-curve cryptography

Elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC) **is a type of public-key cryptography that uses elliptic curves to create and exchange keys, encrypt and decrypt data, and digitally sign messages**. ECC is known for providing the same level of security with smaller key sizes compared to traditional public-key cryptography algorithms such as RSA, making it suitable for resource-constrained devices such as embedded systems and mobile devices.

## Perfect forward secrecy

Perfect forward secrecy (PFS) **is a property of cryptographic protocols where the compromise of long-term secret keys does not compromise past session keys**. In other words, PFS ensures that even if an attacker obtains the private key, they cannot use it to decrypt previously intercepted encrypted communication. This is achieved by using a different key for each session, which is generated on the fly and not stored. PFS provides an additional layer of security for communication and is often used in secure messaging protocols and web browsing.

## Quantum

Quantum **cryptography is a subfield of cryptography that uses principles of quantum mechanics to provide secure communication**. In quantum cryptography, a secure key exchange is performed using quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols, which allow the transmission of cryptographic keys between two parties with unconditional security. The keys are generated based on the quantum properties of photons or other quantum particles, which are inherently random and impossible to copy or measure without disturbing the state of the particles. This ensures that any attempts to eavesdrop on the communication will be detected, as the act of measuring the key will alter its state, alerting the legitimate users.

In the context of computing, quantum cryptography has the potential to revolutionize encryption by using quantum computing to break traditional cryptographic algorithms. Quantum computers can perform certain calculations exponentially faster than classical computers, making it possible to crack current encryption standards in seconds. However, quantum cryptography provides a solution to this problem by using quantum-resistant algorithms that are immune to attacks from quantum computers.

## Post-quantum

Post-quantum, also known as quantum-resistant or quantum-safe, **refers to cryptographic algorithms and systems that are designed to resist attacks by quantum computers**. As quantum computers become more powerful, they may be able to break many of the commonly used cryptographic algorithms that are currently considered secure. Post-quantum cryptography aims to provide security even in the presence of quantum computers by using mathematical problems that are believed to be hard for both classical and quantum computers to solve.

## Ephemeral

Ephemeral **data refers to data that is designed to be used only once and then discarded, such as a one-time password or a temporary encryption key**. Ephemeral keys are frequently used in cryptographic protocols to provide forward secrecy and protect against attacks that rely on the compromise of long-term keys.

## Modes of operation

Modes of operation **are techniques used to process large amounts of data through a block cipher, providing additional security features such as confidentiality and integrity**. Some common modes of operation include ECB, CBC, CFB, OFB, and CTR.

- **Authenticated modes of operation include additional authentication steps**, such as adding an HMAC or a message authentication code (MAC), **to ensure that the message has not been tampered with**. Examples of authenticated modes of operation include GCM and OCB.
- **Unauthenticated modes of operation do not provide any additional authentication steps**, and therefore only provide confidentiality. An example of an unauthenticated mode of operation is ECB.
- **Counter (CTR) mode is a type of stream cipher that allows the encryption and decryption of individual blocks without affecting other blocks**. It generates a keystream by encrypting a counter value and then XORs the keystream with the plaintext. CTR mode is widely used in applications that require parallel processing and is considered to be one of the most efficient modes of operation.

## Blockchain

A blockchain **is a decentralized, distributed digital ledger used to record transactions across many computers in a tamper-resistant way**. Each block in the chain contains a number of transactions and once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks. Public ledgers, which are often implemented using blockchain technology, are open and accessible to anyone who wants to use or contribute to the network. Public ledgers provide transparency, immutability, and decentralization, and are often used for applications such as cryptocurrencies and smart contracts.

Bitcoin and blockchain rely on public key infrastructure (PKI) cryptosystems to ensure safe storage of the currency and the transactions as well. PKI is a system that uses digital certificates and public key cryptography to verify the identity of users and encrypt data transmissions.

## Cipher suites

Cipher suites **refer to a set of cryptographic algorithms and protocols that are used to secure network communications**.

- **Stream ciphers**: operate on plaintext continuously, generating ciphertext one bit at a time, and are often used in applications where the data is transmitted in a continuous stream.
- **Block ciphers**: operate on fixed-length groups of bits, or blocks, and are often used in applications where the data is transmitted in discrete chunks or messages. Block ciphers can be used in various modes of operation such as Cipher Block Chaining (CBC), Electronic Codebook (ECB), and Counter (CTR).

Both stream and block ciphers are used in various cryptographic applications, including secure communications, data encryption, and digital signatures. The choice of the cipher suite depends on the specific requirements of the application and the level of security needed.

## Symmetric vs. asymmetric

Symmetric and asymmetric are two types of encryption techniques used in cryptography.

**Symmetric encryption uses a single key for both encryption and decryption**. This means that the same key is used by both the sender and receiver to encrypt and decrypt the data. Examples of symmetric encryption algorithms include AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and DES (Data Encryption Standard).

**Asymmetric encryption, also known as public-key encryption, uses two different keys for encryption and decryption**. One key is kept private and known only to the owner, while the other key is made public and can be distributed to anyone who needs to send encrypted data to the owner. Examples of asymmetric encryption algorithms include RSA and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC).

**The primary advantage of asymmetric encryption over symmetric encryption is that it enables secure communication without the need for a pre-shared key. However, asymmetric encryption is generally slower and more computationally intensive than symmetric encryption.**

## Lightweight cryptography

Lightweight cryptography **refers to cryptographic algorithms and protocols that are designed to be implemented on devices with limited resources** such as low-power microcontrollers, RFID tags, and sensor networks. These algorithms typically have low memory requirements, low computational complexity, and low power consumption, while still providing strong security.

## Steganography

Steganography **is the practice of hiding a secret message within a medium** such as audio, video, or image without any apparent suspicion. In audio steganography, data can be hidden in the audio signal by modifying the audio data. In video steganography, data can be hidden by modifying the video frames or by modifying the audio signal of the video. In image steganography, data can be hidden in the pixel values of an image or in the metadata of an image file.

## Homomorphic encryption

Homomorphic encryption **is a type of encryption that allows computations to be performed on encrypted data without the need to decrypt it first**. This means that sensitive data can be kept encrypted and still be processed, providing a high level of security and privacy. It has potential applications in various fields, such as finance, healthcare, and cloud computing.

## Common use cases

Cryptography has numerous use cases across various fields. Here are some common use cases and how cryptography can support them:

-   Low power devices: In resource-constrained environments such as IoT devices, lightweight cryptography algorithms like AES-CCM or Chacha20-Poly1305 can be used to encrypt and authenticate data with minimal overhead.
-   Low latency: In high-speed communication networks, symmetric key cryptography can be used for encryption and decryption to reduce latency, as it requires less computation compared to asymmetric key cryptography.
-   High resiliency: Cryptography can be used to ensure data resiliency against attacks like data breaches, ransomware attacks, etc. Cryptographic techniques like encryption, hashing, and digital signatures can help in ensuring data confidentiality, integrity, and non-repudiation.
-   Supporting confidentiality: Cryptography is often used to ensure confidentiality by encrypting sensitive data, rendering it unreadable to unauthorized parties. Encryption techniques like symmetric key cryptography and asymmetric key cryptography can be used for this purpose.
-   Supporting integrity: Cryptography can be used to ensure that data has not been tampered with, and its integrity has been maintained. Techniques like hashing and digital signatures can help in ensuring data integrity.
-   Supporting obfuscation: Cryptography can be used to obfuscate data, making it difficult for attackers to read and understand the information. Techniques like encryption and steganography can be used for this purpose.
-   Supporting authentication: Cryptography can be used for user authentication, ensuring that only authorized users can access the system. Techniques like password hashing and digital certificates can be used for authentication.
-   Supporting non-repudiation: Cryptography can be used to establish non-repudiation, ensuring that parties cannot deny their actions. Techniques like digital signatures can be used to establish non-repudiation.

## Limitations

Cryptography is a fundamental tool for information security, but it has some limitations that need to be considered in various use cases.

**Speed** is a common limitation in cryptography, especially in applications that require real-time processing, such as network communication or streaming media. In such cases, lightweight cryptography algorithms may be used, sacrificing some level of security for improved performance.

**Size** is another limitation in some applications, such as small embedded devices or mobile phones, which have limited storage capacity. Cryptographic algorithms and keys need to fit within these constraints, which may require the use of smaller key sizes or less complex algorithms.

**Weak keys** can also be a limitation in cryptography, as certain keys or configurations may be vulnerable to attacks that can compromise the confidentiality or integrity of the system.

**Time** is a limitation in some cryptographic applications, such as those that require long-term data storage or archiving. In such cases, the longevity of the cryptographic algorithms and keys needs to be considered, as well as the ability to migrate to new algorithms and keys over time.

**Predictability** is a limitation in some cryptographic applications, as some algorithms or modes of operation may be vulnerable to attacks based on predictable patterns or repetitions.

**Reuse of keys** or other cryptographic components can also be a limitation, as it may increase the risk of attacks or compromise the confidentiality or integrity of the system.

**Entropy** is a fundamental limitation in cryptography, as it is necessary to have sufficient randomness or unpredictability in the generation of keys and other cryptographic parameters.

**Computational overheads** can be a limitation in some applications, such as those that require high levels of security or complexity, as the processing power or resources required to perform the cryptographic operations may be prohibitive.

Finally, **resource vs. security constraints** can be a limitation in some applications, as there may be a trade-off between the level of security provided by cryptographic mechanisms and the available resources, such as computing power or bandwidth.
