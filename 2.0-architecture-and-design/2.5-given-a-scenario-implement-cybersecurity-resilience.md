# 2.5 Given a scenario, implement cybersecurity resilience

## Redundancy

Redundancy **is a strategy for ensuring system resilience by duplicating critical components, resources, or systems**. The aim of redundancy is to increase availability, reliability, and fault tolerance by reducing the risk of a single point of failure. Redundancy can be implemented at different levels, including hardware, software, data, and network infrastructure. In cybersecurity, redundancy can be used to ensure continuity of operations and mitigate the impact of cyber attacks or natural disasters. For example, redundant systems can be used to automatically switch over to a backup system in case of a failure, ensuring uninterrupted service.

### Geographic dispersal

Geographic dispersa **refers to the practice of distributing critical data, systems, and infrastructure across multiple geographic locations to minimize the risk of a single point of failure**. This approach can help organizations to maintain operations and continuity in the event of natural disasters, cyberattacks, or other disruptive events.

By having redundant systems and infrastructure in multiple geographic locations, organizations can ensure that if one location is impacted by a disaster or cyberattack, they can continue to operate from another location. Geographic dispersal can be often achieved through the use of cloud-based services, and can also be achieved through the use of physical redundancy, where critical systems and infrastructure are replicated in multiple geographic locations.

### Disk

Disk redundancy **refers to the practice of creating redundant copies of data across multiple physical storage devices or systems to ensure that data remains available even in the event of disk failure**. Two commonly used techniques for disk redundancy are RAID and Multipath.

**RAID (Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks) is a technology that allows multiple physical disks to be combined into a single logical volume**. There are several RAID levels, each with its own method of storing data across multiple disks. The most commonly used RAID levels are:

1.  **RAID 0**: Striping. Data is split evenly across two or more disks, providing increased read and write speeds, but no redundancy.
2.  **RAID 1**: Mirroring. Data is duplicated on two or more disks, providing redundancy but no performance improvement.
3.  **RAID 5**: Striping with parity. Data is split across three or more disks, with one disk dedicated to storing parity information. This provides both increased read and write speeds and redundancy, but requires at least three disks.
4.  **RAID 6**: Striping with double parity. Similar to RAID 5, but with two disks dedicated to storing parity information. This provides redundancy even if two disks fail simultaneously, but requires at least four disks.

**Multipath is a technique that provides redundancy for storage area network (SAN) devices**. Multipath software allows multiple paths between a server and a SAN device to be used simultaneously, ensuring that data remains available even if one of the paths fails. This can improve the performance and reliability of storage systems, particularly in large-scale enterprise environments.

### Network

Network redundancy **is the process of having backup components or systems that can take over if the primary components or systems fail**. This helps to ensure that network services remain available even in the event of a failure. Two common methods of achieving network redundancy are through the use of load balancers and network interface card (NIC) teaming.

**Load balancers are devices that distribute incoming network traffic across multiple servers or network resources**. This helps to evenly distribute the workload across the network and ensures that no one resource is overloaded. If one server or resource fails, the load balancer can automatically redirect traffic to the remaining resources, ensuring that network services remain available.

**Network interface card (NIC) teaming is the process of combining two or more network interface cards into a single virtual NIC**. This helps to ensure that network traffic can continue to flow even if one NIC fails. In addition, NIC teaming can provide increased bandwidth and load balancing capabilities, helping to improve network performance and resilience.

Another example of network redundancy is the use of redundant routers or switches. This involves having multiple routers or switches configured in such a way that if one fails, the other can take over seamlessly, ensuring that network traffic continues to flow uninterrupted.

### Power

Power **redundancy refers to the practice of having backup systems in place to ensure continuous power supply in case of power failures or outages**. Here are some common power redundancy techniques:

1.  **Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS)**: A UPS is a backup power supply that provides power to devices in case of power loss. It typically has a battery that can provide power for a limited time, allowing for a safe shutdown of systems or time for backup power sources to activate.
2.  **Generator**: A generator is a device that produces electrical energy from mechanical energy. It can be used as a backup power source in case of power outages or as a primary power source in remote areas where access to the power grid is limited.
3.  **Dual supply**: Dual supply refers to having two separate power sources that can provide power to a system simultaneously. This ensures that if one power source fails, the other can take over seamlessly without any downtime.
4.  **Managed Power Distribution Units (PDUs)**: A PDU is a device that distributes power to multiple devices from a single power source. A managed PDU provides advanced features like remote power management, outlet-level monitoring, and power usage reporting.

By using these power redundancy techniques, organizations can ensure that critical systems remain operational in case of power disruptions, minimizing downtime and maximizing business continuity.

## Replication

Replication **is a process of creating and maintaining multiple copies of data or applications to ensure availability and resilience in case of failures or disasters**. In the context of cybersecurity, replication plays a crucial role in maintaining business continuity and disaster recovery. Here are some topics related to replication:

1.  **Storage area network (SAN) replication**: A SAN is a high-speed network that connects servers and storage devices in a data center. SAN replication involves replicating data between two or more SANs to ensure data availability and disaster recovery. SAN replication can be synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the distance between the SANs and the network bandwidth.
2.  **VM replication**: Virtual machine replication involves creating and maintaining multiple copies of virtual machines across different hosts or clusters. VM replication can be used to ensure availability and resilience of critical applications running on virtual machines. VM replication can be synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the replication technology used.

Replication is a critical component of disaster recovery and business continuity planning. It helps organizations to maintain continuous access to critical data and applications in the event of a disaster or failure. However, replication can also increase the complexity and cost of IT infrastructure, so it is important to carefully evaluate the replication needs and choose the right technology and configuration to meet the organization's requirements.

## On-premises vs. cloud

**On-premises resilience refers to the ability of an organization's IT infrastructure to withstand and recover from disruptions or failures**, such as hardware failures, power outages, or natural disasters. This is typically achieved through redundancy and disaster recovery planning, such as having multiple power sources, backups, and failover mechanisms in place.

**Cloud resilience**, on the other hand, **refers to the ability of a cloud-based system to remain available and recover from disruptions or failures**. Cloud providers typically offer built-in resilience features, such as replication across multiple data centers, automatic failover, and backup and recovery services.

In comparison to on-premises resilience, cloud resilience can offer several advantages, including:

1.  Scalability: Cloud-based systems can easily scale up or down to meet changing demand, which can be particularly useful during times of high traffic or increased workload.
2.  Flexibility: Cloud providers often offer a wide range of services and configurations, which can be customized to meet the specific needs of an organization.
3.  Reduced management overhead: Cloud providers are responsible for maintaining and updating the underlying infrastructure, which can reduce the management burden on an organization.

However, there are also potential disadvantages to relying solely on cloud resilience, including:

1.  Dependence on the cloud provider: Organizations may have limited control over the underlying infrastructure and may be at the mercy of the cloud provider in the event of a disruption or outage.
2.  Security concerns: Cloud-based systems can be vulnerable to security threats, such as data breaches or hacking attempts, which can impact both the organization and its customers.
3.  Cost: While cloud-based systems can be cost-effective in some cases, they can also be expensive, particularly if an organization requires high levels of availability and redundancy.

## Backup types

Backup **is the process of creating and maintaining copies of important data in case the original data is lost or corrupted**. Here are the different types of backups:

- **Full backup**: A full backup copies all the data in a system, including files, folders, and applications.
- **Incremental backup**: An incremental backup only copies data that has changed since the last backup, saving time and storage space.
- **Snapshot backup**: A snapshot backup captures the state of a system at a particular point in time, enabling quick restoration to that exact state.
- **Differential backup**: A differential backup copies all data that has changed since the last full backup.
- **Tape backup**: Tape backup involves copying data onto magnetic tapes that can be stored offline or offsite for safekeeping.
- **Disk backup**: Disk backup involves copying data onto external hard drives or other storage devices for quick and easy restoration.
- **Copy backup**: A copy backup makes an exact copy of the data without compression or encryption, ensuring that the backup is an exact replica of the original.
- **Network-attached storage (NAS) backup**: NAS backup involves storing backup data on a separate NAS device, providing easy access and management of backup data.
- **Storage area network (SAN) backup**: SAN backup involves copying data onto a separate storage area network for easy access and management.
- **Cloud backup**: Cloud backup involves copying data onto a cloud-based storage service, providing secure offsite storage and easy restoration.
- **Image backup**: An image backup involves creating a complete image of a system, including the operating system, settings, and applications.
- **Online vs. offline backup**: Online backup involves copying data while the system is running, while offline backup involves copying data while the system is turned off.
- **Offsite storage**: Offsite storage involves storing backups in a different physical location than the original data, protecting against disasters that could affect the primary location. Distance considerations should be taken into account, such as ensuring that the offsite storage is far enough away to be safe from the same disaster that could affect the primary location.

## Non-persistence

Non-persistence resilience **refers to the ability of a system to maintain its critical functions and services despite disruptions or attacks that attempt to compromise or destroy the system**. One approach to achieving non-persistence resilience is to use techniques that allow the system to revert to a known-good state or configuration in the event of an incident.

Here are some techniques that can be used for non-persistence resilience:

1.  **Revert to known state**: This technique involves periodically restoring the system to a known-good state. This can be done by taking regular system backups or by creating restore points that capture a snapshot of the system's state at a particular time. In the event of a security incident or system failure, the system can be rolled back to the last known-good state to restore its functionality.
2.  **Last known-good configuration**: This technique involves saving a copy of the system's last known-good configuration, which can be used to restore the system's functionality in the event of a security incident or system failure. This technique is often used in conjunction with backup and recovery processes.
3.  **Live boot media**: This technique involves booting the system from a read-only medium, such as a CD or USB drive, that contains a pre-configured operating system and applications. This technique provides an isolated environment that is immune to malware and other attacks, and can be used to recover critical data or to restore the system's functionality in the event of a security incident or system failure.

These techniques are useful for systems that are highly critical and cannot tolerate any downtime or disruption. They are commonly used in industries such as healthcare, finance, and government, where system availability is essential. Distance considerations are also important when it comes to offsite storage, as the distance between the primary and secondary locations should be enough to prevent both from being affected by a single event, such as a natural disaster or power outage.

## High availability

High availability and scalability are two important concepts related to system resilience and performance.

**High availability refers to the ability of a system to remain operational and accessible even in the event of failures or outages**. The goal of high availability is to minimize downtime and maintain service levels for end-users. This is often achieved through the use of redundant systems, such as backup servers, load balancers, and clustering. In the case of a failure, these redundant systems can seamlessly take over and continue to provide services to users without any disruption.

**Scalability**, on the other hand, **refers to the ability of a system to handle increasing amounts of workload or traffic without degrading in performance**. A scalable system is designed to be flexible and adaptable, allowing it to accommodate growth and changes in demand. This is often achieved through the use of distributed architectures and load balancing techniques that enable the system to distribute workload across multiple servers or nodes.

A highly available system is typically also scalable, as it is designed to be resilient and capable of handling fluctuations in traffic or demand. Similarly, a scalable system must also be highly available to ensure that it can continue to function under heavy load or in the event of failures.

## Restoration order

Restoration order **is the sequence in which an organization restores its systems, applications, and data after a disaster or disruptive event**. It is essential to have a well-defined restoration order to minimize downtime and resume operations as quickly as possible.

The restoration order should be based on criticality and recovery time objectives (RTOs) for each system, application, and data set. Critical systems and applications that are required for the organization's core business operations should be given the highest priority for restoration. The RTOs for each system should also be considered, with the most time-sensitive systems restored first. It should also take into account dependencies between systems and applications.

## Diversity

Diversity is an essential aspect of resilience planning. Diverse technologies, vendors, and cryptographic controls provide options and flexibility to mitigate risks, prevent system failure, and improve recovery time. The use of different technologies, such as hardware and software, can reduce the risk of a single point of failure. Employing multiple vendors and suppliers can reduce the risk of supply chain attacks and the dependence on a single source of technology. Cryptographic diversity can also be used to provide multiple levels of security and reduce the risk of a single cryptographic algorithm being compromised. Additionally, incorporating different security controls, such as access controls, network segmentation, and monitoring, can improve overall resilience by creating multiple layers of defense.

Overall, the use of diverse technologies, vendors, cryptographic controls, and security controls can enhance resilience planning and increase the ability of an organization to recover from disruptions or incidents.
