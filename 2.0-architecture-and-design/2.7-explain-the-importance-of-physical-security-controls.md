# 2.7 Explain the importance of physical security controls

Physical security controls refer to the measures and protocols that are put in place to protect physical assets, resources, and facilities from unauthorized access, damage, theft, or other physical threats.

## Bollards/barricades

Bollards/barricades **are physical security controls used to restrict or control vehicle or pedestrian traffic in certain areas, such as around buildings, infrastructure, or sensitive sites**. They are designed to prevent or deter unauthorized access, ramming attacks, or vehicular-borne improvised explosive devices (VBIEDs) by providing a physical barrier that can withstand a certain level of impact or force. Bollards/barricades can be fixed or removable, and made of different materials such as steel, concrete, or bollard sleeves that can be filled with concrete or sand.

## Access control vestibules

Access control vestibules **are small rooms located at the entry point of a building, designed to enhance security by creating a buffer zone between the outside environment and the inside of the building**. Vestibules usually consist of two sets of doors, one that opens to the outside and another that leads to the interior of the building. The doors are electronically controlled, and one set cannot be opened until the other set is closed. This ensures that only authorized individuals gain access to the building.

## Badges

Badges **are physical tokens or cards that are used to identify individuals and grant them access to secure areas within a building or facility**. They often contain personal information such as the person's name, photograph, job title, and department. They can also be encoded with access privileges or permissions, allowing individuals to enter specific areas or rooms based on their role or clearance level. Badges may also be used to track employee movement and activity within the facility.

## Alarms

Alarms **are security devices that alert individuals or security personnel when an unauthorized access attempt or breach occurs**. They can be triggered by different factors such as motion detection, door and window contacts, glass breakage, and heat or smoke detection. Alarms can also be designed to sound silently, alerting security personnel without alarming the intruder, or with loud sirens to scare off the intruder.

## Signage

Signage **refers to the use of visual communication in the form of signs, symbols, and graphics to convey information and instructions to people in a physical space**. Signage can be used to indicate restricted areas, warn of potential hazards, provide directions, or display emergency information. Signage can be highly effective in improving security by clearly communicating rules and expectations to employees, visitors, and other individuals in a facility. It can also act as a deterrent by alerting potential intruders that security measures are in place. Effective signage should be clear, concise, and easy to understand, and should be strategically placed in high-traffic areas where it is easily visible.

## Cameras

Cameras **are electronic devices that capture and record visual information, and they are an essential physical security control in many settings**. Cameras can be used for a variety of purposes, including monitoring activity, deterring crime, and providing evidence in the event of an incident. Two important features of modern cameras are motion recognition and object detection. **Motion recognition allows cameras to detect movement** and trigger an alarm or recording when activity is detected in a specified area. **Object detection allows cameras to recognize and track specific objects or individuals** based on pre-defined criteria, such as facial recognition or license plate recognition. These features can enhance the effectiveness of camera surveillance systems and improve the security of a facility. However, it is important to consider the privacy implications of using cameras, and to ensure that they are deployed in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

## Closed-circuit television (CCTV)

Closed-circuit television (CCTV) **is a surveillance system that uses cameras to transmit video signals to a specific set of monitors**. The signals are not publicly distributed, unlike broadcast television, hence the term "closed-circuit". CCTV cameras are commonly used for surveillance and security purposes in various settings such as public areas, businesses, and homes. The footage captured by CCTV cameras can be stored and reviewed later to identify security breaches or incidents.

## Industrial camouflage

Industrial camouflage **is a physical security control that involves the use of materials, colors, and patterns to blend in a facility or equipment with its surroundings to make it harder to detect or recognize**. The goal of industrial camouflage is to provide protection against unauthorized access or reconnaissance by making it difficult for potential attackers to identify the target. Industrial camouflage can be applied to buildings, vehicles, and other equipment, and it is often used in military and high-security applications.

## Personnel

Personnel **are physical security controls that involve human beings in various roles**. These controls are designed to ensure the safety and security of a facility or organization.

-   Guards: Security guards are hired to protect the premises and keep watch over the property. They may be armed or unarmed, and may be stationed at entry points, roam the premises, or monitor security systems.
-   Robot sentries: Robot sentries are machines designed to patrol the premises, detect intruders, and sound alarms if necessary. They may also have the ability to take defensive measures against intruders.
-   Reception: Reception is a security control that involves a person stationed at the entrance of a facility, who is responsible for verifying the identity of visitors, checking them in, and issuing visitor badges.
-   Two-person integrity/control: Two-person integrity/control is a security control that requires two individuals to work together to perform a task. This is often used in scenarios where high-value assets are being handled, and it reduces the risk of fraud, theft, or error.

## Locks

A lock **is a physical device that is designed to prevent unauthorized access to a space or object**. There are several types of locks available in the market, each designed to provide different levels of security. Some examples are:

- **Biometric locks**: These locks use a person's unique physical characteristics, such as fingerprints or iris scans, for authentication. They provide a high level of security but can be expensive to install and maintain.
- **Electronic locks**: These locks use electronic systems, such as a keypad or smart card, for authentication. They are more convenient to use than traditional physical locks and can be easily integrated with other security systems.
- **Physical locks**: These locks are the traditional locks that use keys or combination locks for authentication. They are widely used due to their simplicity and low cost.
- **Cable locks**: These locks use a cable to secure an object to a stationary object. They are commonly used to secure bicycles or laptops and are easy to use and transport.

Each type of lock has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of lock will depend on the level of security required and the specific needs of the user.

## USB data blocker

A USB data blocker, also known as a USB condom or USB privacy device, **is a small electronic device that is designed to prevent unauthorized data transfer or hacking when using USB charging ports or public charging stations**. The device blocks data transfer pins on a USB cable, allowing only power transfer pins to work. This prevents any malicious data transfer and keeps personal or sensitive data safe. USB data blockers are commonly used for charging mobile devices, laptops, and other USB-powered devices in public places such as airports, cafes, and hotels.

## Lighting

Lighting **refers to the use of artificial or natural light sources to illuminate an area, whether indoor or outdoor, to increase visibility, provide security, and enhance aesthetic appeal**. Proper lighting is an essential component of physical security controls as it can deter criminal activities, facilitate surveillance, and provide a safe and secure environment for occupants. In addition to traditional lighting fixtures, modern lighting systems can include advanced features such as motion sensors, timers, and remote controls, allowing for more effective and efficient use of lighting resources.

## Fencing

Fencing **is a physical security control used to restrict access to a specific area or property by creating a physical barrier**. Fences can be made of various materials such as wood, metal, or wire mesh and can come in different heights and styles to meet specific security needs. Fencing can provide a visual deterrent, prevent unauthorized access, and help to keep people and animals out of restricted areas. Fences can be used in a variety of settings, including industrial sites, government buildings, and residential properties.

## Fire suppression

Fire suppression systems **are designed to control and extinguish fires, typically through the use of chemicals, water, or gases**. They are installed in buildings and other facilities to prevent fires from spreading and causing damage or injury. Common types of fire suppression systems include sprinkler systems, which use water to extinguish fires, and gas suppression systems, which use gases such as carbon dioxide or halon to smother flames. Some fire suppression systems are automatic and triggered by heat or smoke sensors, while others are manually activated.

## Sensors

Sensors **are electronic devices that detect and respond to physical or environmental stimuli**, such as motion, temperature, or noise. They are commonly used in security systems to monitor and alert for potential threats. **Motion sensors detect movement** and can trigger an alarm or surveillance camera. **Noise sensors detect unusual sounds or disruptions** and can alert security personnel. **Proximity readers use radio frequency identification (RFID) or other technology to identify authorized personnel or objects**. **Moisture sensors detect water or moisture**, which can indicate the presence of leaks or other water-related issues. **Temperature sensors measure the ambient temperature** and can alert to changes in temperature that may indicate a fire or other environmental hazard.

## Drones

Drones, also known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), **are aircraft that are remotely controlled or operate autonomously through software-controlled flight plans**. They can be used for various purposes, including military operations, surveillance, and commercial applications such as photography, package delivery, and inspection of infrastructure. Drones typically have sensors such as cameras, GPS, and accelerometers to help with navigation and data collection. They come in various sizes and designs, from small quadcopters to large fixed-wing aircraft.

## Visitor logs

Visitor logs **are records maintained by an organization or facility to keep track of visitors who enter the premises**. The log typically includes information such as the visitor's name, the purpose of their visit, the date and time of their arrival and departure, and the name of the person they are meeting. The purpose of maintaining a visitor log is to ensure accountability and security, as it can be used to track who has entered the facility and when. In case of any security breach or incident, the visitor log can be used as evidence for investigations.

## Faraday cage

A Faraday cage **is a conductive enclosure that blocks electromagnetic fields (EMF) and waves, including radio waves, microwaves, and electromagnetic radiation**. It is made of a conductive material such as copper or aluminum and is designed to protect electronic equipment and devices from external electromagnetic interference (EMI). The Faraday cage works by creating an electromagnetic shield around the enclosed equipment, preventing any EMF from entering or leaving the cage. It is commonly used in various applications, including scientific experiments, military and defense systems, and even in everyday devices like microwaves and cell phones to prevent interference with other electronic equipment.

## Air gap

An air gap **is a security measure used to isolate a computer or network from external networks or the internet to prevent unauthorized access, data leakage, or cyber attacks**. It involves physically separating a system or network from other systems or networks by disconnecting it from external networks, such as the internet or local networks, using an air gap. The air gap is meant to create a physical barrier that prevents data from being transferred in or out of the system, which can be useful for protecting highly sensitive information such as government secrets or financial data. However, air gaps are not foolproof and can still be breached by physical access or social engineering attacks.

## Screened subnet (previously known as demilitarized zone)

A screened subnet, also known as a demilitarized zone (DMZ), **is a network architecture commonly used in computer networks to add an additional layer of security by segregating an internal network from an external network**. The screened subnet sits between the internal network and the external network and contains devices such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems that filter traffic to and from the internal network. The screened subnet is designed to provide a buffer zone where traffic from the outside world can be monitored and filtered before it is allowed to reach the internal network, thus providing an extra layer of protection against external threats.

## Protected cable distribution

Protected cable distribution **is a physical security measure used to protect network cabling from being tampered with or physically compromised**. The protected cables are often housed within secure conduits or routed through secure pathways, and are protected against physical access or attacks by measures such as armored sheathing or shielding. This is particularly important for critical infrastructure and sensitive environments where the physical security of network cabling is as important as cybersecurity measures.

## Secure areas

Secure areas **refer to physical locations, rooms, or facilities that are specifically designed and implemented with security measures** to safeguard sensitive information, assets, and critical infrastructure against unauthorized access, theft, vandalism, or physical damage. Secure areas may include multiple layers of security controls, such as access control systems, biometric authentication, surveillance cameras, motion sensors, alarms, and other measures to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information and assets within them. Some examples are:

- **Air gap**: Physical isolation of a computer or network from unsecured networks or systems.
- **Vault**: A secure room or structure designed to protect valuables, such as money, documents, or data, from theft, fire, or other hazards.
- **Safe**: A secure container designed to store and protect valuables, such as money, documents, or data, from theft, fire, or other hazards.
- **Hot aisle**: A containment system used in data centers to manage the flow of hot air generated by equipment.
- **Cold aisle**: A containment system used in data centers to manage the flow of cool air to equipment.

## Secure data destruction

Secure data destruction **refers to the process of permanently and securely erasing data from a storage device to prevent unauthorized access or recovery of sensitive information**. It involves various methods such as burning, shredding, pulping, pulverizing, degaussing, and using third-party solutions to ensure that data is completely destroyed and cannot be recovered.

- Burning involves incinerating the device or media.
- Shredding involves physically shredding the media into small pieces.
- Pulping involves reducing the media to a pulp.
- Pulverizing involves grinding it into small particles.
- Degaussing involves erasing the data by exposing the media to a strong magnetic field.
- Third-party solutions involve hiring a professional service to perform the secure data destruction process.
