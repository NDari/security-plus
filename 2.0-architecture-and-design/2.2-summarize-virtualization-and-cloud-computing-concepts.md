# 2.2 Summarize virtualization and cloud computing concepts

## Cloud models

Cloud computing has become an increasingly popular method of delivering IT resources and services over the internet. There are several cloud service models that organizations can use, each with their own set of characteristics and considerations.

1. **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS**): This model provides organizations with virtualized computing resources, including servers, storage, networking, and other infrastructure components. With IaaS, organizations can deploy and manage their own operating systems, applications, and middleware.
2. **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**: In this model, cloud service providers offer a platform that enables customers to develop, run, and manage their own applications without the need to manage the underlying infrastructure. PaaS providers typically offer a pre-configured development environment, as well as tools for application deployment, testing, and management.
3. **Software as a Service (SaaS)**: In this model, cloud service providers deliver fully functional software applications over the internet. SaaS applications are typically accessible via a web browser or a mobile app, and are managed by the provider.
4. **Anything as a Service (XaaS)**: This model refers to the delivery of any kind of IT service over the internet. This includes services like security as a service, data as a service, and network as a service.

Cloud services can also be categorized based on their deployment models:

1. **Public cloud**: Public cloud services are hosted by third-party providers and can be accessed by anyone with an internet connection. Public cloud services are typically delivered over a pay-as-you-go model, where customers only pay for the resources they use.
2. **Community cloud**: Community clouds are shared by several organizations with common computing requirements. This deployment model enables organizations to benefit from the advantages of cloud computing while retaining control over their data and applications.
3. **Private cloud**: Private clouds are dedicated to a single organization and are typically hosted on-premises or in a data center. Private clouds offer greater control and security, but require significant upfront investment.
4. **Hybrid cloud**: Hybrid clouds are a combination of two or more cloud deployment models (public, private, or community) that remain separate entities but are integrated to provide a cohesive infrastructure. Hybrid clouds enable organizations to take advantage of the benefits of both public and private clouds.

## Cloud service providers

Cloud service providers (CSPs) **are companies that offer cloud computing services to businesses and individuals**. These services may include hosting applications and data, storing and managing data, providing infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and software as a service (SaaS). CSPs may also offer security services, backup and recovery, and other services related to cloud computing. Examples of CSPs include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and IBM Cloud.

## Managed service provider (MSP)/ managed security service provider (MSSP)

**A Managed Service Provider (MSP) is a company that provides a range of IT services and support to its clients**, typically on a subscription basis. These services can include network management, data backup and recovery, software installation and maintenance, security monitoring, and more. The goal of an MSP is to help its clients streamline their IT operations and reduce the burden of managing their own IT infrastructure.

**A Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP) is a type of MSP that specializes in providing security-related services to its clients**. These services can include threat monitoring, incident response, vulnerability assessments, penetration testing, and more. The MSSP typically provides these services remotely, using a combination of automated tools and human expertise to identify and respond to security threats. The goal of an MSSP is to help its clients improve their overall security posture and reduce the risk of cyber attacks.

## On-premises vs. off-premises

**On-premises** refers to the infrastructure and applications that are located **within an organization's physical facility**, managed and maintained by the organization's own staff. In contrast, **off-premises** refers to infrastructure and applications that are **hosted and managed by a third-party** service provider and accessed remotely through the internet or private network connections. Off-premises solutions are typically based on cloud computing technology and may be offered as a public, private, or hybrid cloud service. The choice between on-premises and off-premises solutions depends on the organization's requirements for control, customization, cost, scalability, and security.

## Fog computing vs Edge computing

Fog computing **is a distributed computing infrastructure in which data, computing, and storage resources are located at the edge of the network, closer to the end-users and devices that generate and consume data**. Fog computing provides a way to process data locally, instead of sending all data to a centralized cloud, allowing for faster processing and reduced latency.

Edge computing **is a distributed computing paradigm that involves processing and storing data near the edge of a network, rather than relying on a central location**. In edge computing, data is processed closer to the source, such as on devices themselves or in nearby servers, rather than being sent to a central data center or cloud for processing.

Edge computing and fog computing are both emerging technologies that extend cloud computing capabilities to the edge of the network, but they differ in several ways:

1.  Architecture: Edge computing relies on local devices to perform data processing and analysis, while fog computing uses a distributed network of devices, including gateways, routers, and switches, to provide a platform for computation and data storage.
2.  Proximity: Edge computing involves deploying computing resources as close as possible to the end-users or the devices that generate the data, while fog computing focuses on providing computational resources close to the data source, such as sensors or IoT devices.
3.  Scalability: Edge computing can be challenging to scale due to the limited resources of local devices, while fog computing can be more scalable by using a distributed network of devices that can be managed and orchestrated centrally.
4.  Latency: Edge computing provides low latency by processing data locally, while fog computing can offer low latency by distributing computation and storage closer to the data source.
5.  Security: Both edge and fog computing face unique security challenges, but fog computing can provide a more secure environment by placing computational resources closer to the data source, reducing the exposure to cyber threats.

In summary, edge computing and fog computing are similar in that they both aim to extend cloud computing capabilities to the edge of the network, but they differ in architecture, proximity, scalability, latency, and security.

## Thin client

A thin client **is a computer or client device that relies heavily on a server to perform most of its processing and data storage functions**. It is a type of computer that does not have a hard disk drive or other storage media, and it depends on a network for its resources, including applications, memory, storage, and processing power. The thin client is designed to be lightweight, energy-efficient, and low-cost, with a minimalistic hardware configuration. It is often used in enterprise environments where centralized management, security, and cost savings are critical.

## Containers

Containers **are a lightweight virtualization technology that allows for the creation and deployment of isolated software environments, called containers, on a single host machine**. Containers provide an abstraction layer between the application and the host operating system, making it easier to deploy and manage applications across different environments, such as development, testing, and production.

Containers use the host operating system's kernel, libraries, and other resources, which makes them lightweight and fast to start up and shut down. Each container includes only the necessary dependencies and configuration files required to run the application, making them highly portable and efficient. Containers can be managed and orchestrated using tools like Docker and Kubernetes, which provide a high level of automation and scalability for containerized applications.

## Microservices/API

Microservices and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are two related concepts in software development that are increasingly used in modern computing environments.

**Microservices refer to the architectural approach of building an application as a collection of small, independently deployable services that work together to provide the required functionality**. Each microservice is a self-contained component that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently from the rest of the application. Microservices are typically designed to be lightweight, scalable, and resilient, and are often implemented using containerization technologies like Docker and Kubernetes.

**APIs**, on the other hand, **are a way for applications to interact with each other or with external services**. APIs define a set of rules and protocols for communication between different software systems, and enable applications to exchange data and functionality with each other. APIs can be public or private, and can be used to expose a variety of functionality, from simple data access to more complex services like machine learning algorithms.

In modern software development, microservices and APIs often go hand in hand, with microservices using APIs to communicate with each other and with external systems. This approach enables developers to build complex applications more quickly and efficiently, by breaking down the application into smaller, more manageable pieces and leveraging existing services through APIs.

## Infrastructure as code

Infrastructure as code (IaC) **is an approach to managing and provisioning IT infrastructure through machine-readable configuration files instead of manual intervention**. IaC enables administrators to automate the deployment of resources, configuration management, and other operational tasks, reducing the chance of human error and increasing efficiency.

Software-defined networking (SDN) is a type of network architecture where the control and management planes are decoupled from the underlying network hardware, allowing network administrators to manage network services through a central location. SDN can be implemented through IaC, where the network infrastructure is defined in code and can be quickly provisioned, changed, or removed.

Software-defined visibility (SDV) is another approach to managing network infrastructure through machine-readable configuration files. SDV enables network administrators to centrally configure and manage traffic visibility policies and access controls, making it easier to identify and mitigate security threats.

Both SDN and SDV are examples of how IaC can be used to manage and automate network infrastructure.

## Serverless architecture

Serverless architecture, also known as Function as a Service (FaaS), **is a cloud computing model that allows developers to run their application code without having to manage the underlying infrastructure**. With serverless architecture, the cloud provider takes care of the infrastructure needed to run the code, such as servers, operating systems, and runtime environments, and developers simply write and deploy their code as functions.

In serverless architecture, applications are built around a set of functions that are triggered by specific events, such as an incoming request or a change in a data store. These functions can be written in a variety of programming languages and are typically short-lived, running for only a few seconds to process a specific request. Because serverless architecture scales automatically to meet demand, it can be a cost-effective solution for applications that have unpredictable or variable workloads.

Serverless architecture can also provide increased security, as the cloud provider is responsible for maintaining the infrastructure and implementing security measures such as encryption and access control. Additionally, serverless architecture can reduce the time and effort required for application deployment and management, as developers can focus on writing and deploying their functions rather than managing the underlying infrastructure.

## Services integration

Services integration **refers to the process of combining and connecting different software services, applications, or systems together to function as a cohesive whole**. The goal of services integration is to enable seamless data flow and communication between different components within an organization's IT infrastructure.

This can be achieved through various methods such as application programming interfaces (APIs), middleware, message queues, service-oriented architectures (SOAs), and enterprise service buses (ESBs). Service integration is becoming increasingly important as organizations continue to adopt cloud-based and hybrid IT infrastructures, which often consist of multiple interconnected systems and applications.

## Resource policies

Resource policies **refer to the set of rules or configuration settings that determine how a particular resource or set of resources should be accessed or managed within a cloud environment**. These policies can be applied to a wide range of cloud resources, including virtual machines, storage volumes, databases, and network components.

Resource policies allow administrators to control access to cloud resources and enforce specific security and compliance requirements. For example, policies may specify which users or groups are authorized to access a particular resource, what actions they are allowed to perform, and under what conditions. Additionally, policies may define specific requirements around data protection, network access, auditing, and logging.

In general, resource policies are defined using a declarative language, such as JSON or YAML, which specifies the desired state of a resource. These policies can be managed and applied through a variety of tools and interfaces, including cloud provider consoles, command-line tools, and automation frameworks.

## Transit gateway

A transit gateway **is a horizontally scalable service that allows users to connect Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) and remote networks together**. It acts as a hub to enable network traffic routing among the connected networks and serves as a central point to apply various network policies and controls. Transit gateway simplifies network management by reducing the need for complex peering connections between VPCs and provides more control over network traffic between VPCs and external networks.

## Virtualization

Virtualization **is the process of creating a virtual version of something, such as a virtual machine (VM) that behaves like a physical computer**. It involves the use of software to create a simulated environment that can run various operating systems or applications.

Virtual machine (VM) sprawl avoidance is the practice of managing and controlling the growth of virtual machines in a virtualized environment. It involves creating policies and procedures to ensure that virtual machines are created, used, and decommissioned in a controlled and organized manner.

VM escape protection is the practice of securing virtual machines from unauthorized access or exploitation by a host system or another virtual machine. It involves implementing security measures such as access controls, network segmentation, and vulnerability management to prevent attackers from exploiting vulnerabilities in the virtualization environment to gain access to sensitive data or systems.
