# 1.2 Given a scenario, analyze potential indicators to determine the type of attack

## Malware

Malware **is a type of software that is designed to harm or exploit computers, networks, or other digital devices**. The term "*malware*" is short for "*malicious software*".

Malware can take many different forms, including viruses, worms, Trojans, ransomware, spyware, adware, and more. Malware is often spread through email attachments, malicious websites, or other types of online downloads.

Once installed on a device, malware can cause a range of harmful effects, including stealing sensitive data, taking control of the device, damaging or destroying files or programs, monitoring the user's online activity, displaying unwanted ads, and more.

To protect against malware, individuals and organizations can use a variety of cybersecurity measures, including antivirus software, firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and good online security practices such as avoiding suspicious emails and downloads, keeping software up to date, and using strong passwords.

### Ransomware

Ransomware **is a type of malware that is designed to encrypt a victim's data and demand payment**, typically in the form of cryptocurrency, in exchange for the decryption key needed to restore access to the data.

Once a system is infected with ransomware, the malware will typically display a ransom note, which explains that the victim's files have been encrypted and provides instructions for how to pay the ransom. The ransom note often includes a deadline for payment, and threatens to permanently delete or destroy the encrypted files if the payment is not made in time.

Ransomware can be spread through a variety of methods, including email attachments, software vulnerabilities, and social engineering tactics. Some variants of ransomware are also capable of spreading laterally across a network, infecting multiple systems within an organization.

To protect against ransomware, individuals and organizations should take steps to prevent infection, such as by using up-to-date antivirus software, regularly backing up important data, and training employees to recognize and avoid phishing attacks. In the event that a ransomware infection does occur, it is generally recommended to avoid paying the ransom, as there is no guarantee that the attackers will provide the decryption key, and payment may encourage further attacks.

### Trojans

A Trojan, or Trojan horse, **is a type of malware that is designed to look like a legitimate program or file but actually has malicious functionality hidden inside**. Trojans typically operate by tricking users into downloading and installing them, often through social engineering tactics such as email attachments or fake software updates.

Once installed on a system, a Trojan can perform a variety of malicious actions, such as stealing sensitive data, taking control of the system, installing additional malware, or creating backdoors for remote access by attackers. Trojans can be designed to target specific types of systems or data, and can be customized to suit the goals of the attacker.

Unlike viruses and worms, which are self-replicating and can spread from system to system, Trojans typically require some degree of user interaction to spread. However, once installed on a system, Trojans can be difficult to detect and remove, as they often use advanced techniques such as rootkits to hide their presence.

To protect against Trojans, individuals and organizations should use up-to-date antivirus software, avoid downloading software or files from untrusted sources, and be wary of suspicious emails or messages. It is also important to keep software and operating systems up to date with the latest security patches to prevent exploitation of known vulnerabilities.

### Worms

A worm **is a type of malware that is designed to replicate itself and spread from system to system**, often through network connections or email attachments. Unlike viruses, worms do not require a host program to spread and can replicate and spread independently.

Once a worm infects a system, it can carry out a variety of malicious actions, such as stealing sensitive data, installing additional malware, or using the infected system to launch attacks on other systems. Worms can be designed to target specific types of systems or data, and can be customized to suit the goals of the attacker.

Worms can spread rapidly and cause widespread damage to computer networks and systems. In some cases, worms can cause denial-of-service attacks by overwhelming network resources with traffic or by exploiting vulnerabilities in network protocols.

To protect against worms, individuals and organizations should use up-to-date antivirus software, keep software and operating systems up to date with the latest security patches, and be cautious when opening email attachments or clicking on links from untrusted sources. It is also important to practice good security hygiene, such as using strong passwords and avoiding the use of default or easily guessable passwords.

### Potentially unwanted programs (PUPs)

Potentially unwanted programs (PUPs) **are software applications that are not inherently malicious, but are generally considered undesirable or problematic for computer users**. Examples of PUPs include adware, browser hijackers, toolbars, and other types of software that may display unwanted ads, change browser settings, or collect and transmit user data without consent.

PUPs are often bundled with other software downloads, and may be installed without the user's knowledge or consent. Once installed, PUPs may be difficult to remove and can cause a variety of problems, such as slowing down system performance, displaying unwanted pop-up ads, or redirecting web searches to unwanted sites.

While not always harmful, PUPs can be a security risk and may compromise the user's privacy and security. To protect against PUPs, it is important to be cautious when downloading software from the internet, and to use reputable antivirus software that can detect and remove potentially unwanted programs.

### Fileless virus

A fileless virus **is a type of malware that operates using advanced techniques to avoid detection and infect systems without leaving any traces on the hard drive**. Unlike traditional viruses, which infect executable files or other types of files on the system, fileless viruses operate entirely in memory, using legitimate system processes to carry out their malicious actions.

Fileless viruses are often spread through spear-phishing attacks, where attackers send targeted emails containing malicious links or attachments. Once the user clicks on the link or opens the attachment, the fileless virus is downloaded and executed in memory, allowing it to carry out a variety of malicious actions, such as stealing sensitive data or downloading additional malware.

Because fileless viruses operate entirely in memory and do not leave any files or other traces on the hard drive, they can be difficult to detect and remove using traditional antivirus software. To protect against fileless viruses, it is important to use a combination of security measures, such as antivirus software, firewalls, and intrusion detection systems, as well as best practices for cybersecurity, such as avoiding suspicious links and attachments, and keeping software and operating systems up to date with the latest security patches.

### Command and control

Command and control (C&C) **refers to a mechanism used by attackers to remotely control malware-infected devices or systems**. It allows the attacker to send commands to the malware on the infected devices, instructing it to carry out various malicious actions, such as stealing sensitive information, launching DDoS attacks, or installing additional malware.

Typically, a C&C server is used to issue commands to the malware, and the infected devices or systems communicate with the C&C server to receive instructions and report back on their activities. C&C communication can take many forms, such as HTTP requests, IRC channels, or custom protocols designed specifically for the malware.

The use of C&C is a key feature of many advanced persistent threats (APTs) and other sophisticated cyber attacks. Because the attacker can control the infected devices remotely, C&C allows for stealthy and persistent access to compromised systems, as well as the ability to update or modify the malware to evade detection by security software. Defending against C&C attacks typically involves identifying and blocking communication between infected devices and the C&C server, and implementing other security measures to prevent malware infections in the first place.

### Bots

Bots, short for "*robots*," **are software programs that are designed to perform automated tasks on the internet**. Bots can be used for a variety of purposes, including web crawling, data scraping, and chatbots for customer support. However, some bots are created and used by cybercriminals for malicious purposes, such as launching DDoS attacks, stealing personal information, or spreading malware.

Botnets are networks of computers or devices that have been infected with malware and are under the control of a botmaster. The infected devices are often referred to as "*bots*" or "*zombies*," and the botmaster can use them to carry out coordinated attacks on other targets, such as websites or servers. The botmaster can remotely control the botnet using a command and control (C&C) server, which issues commands to the bots and receives reports on their activities.

Botnets can be difficult to detect and dismantle, as the individual bots are often spread across multiple networks and geographic locations. Defending against botnets typically involves implementing security measures to prevent infections, such as using antivirus software and keeping software and systems up to date with security patches. Additionally, identifying and blocking communication with the C&C server can help prevent the botnet from carrying out further attacks.

### Cryptomalware

Cryptomalware, also known as ransomware, is a type of malware that encrypts files on a victim's computer or device, making them inaccessible to the user. The attacker then demands a ransom payment from the victim in exchange for the decryption key that will unlock the files.

Cryptomalware typically spreads through email attachments, malicious downloads, or vulnerabilities in software or operating systems. Once it infects a device, it will often attempt to spread to other connected devices on the network.

There are several different types of cryptomalware, including screen lockers, which lock the user out of their device entirely, and file-encrypting ransomware, which encrypts the user's files. Some variants of cryptomalware threaten to publish sensitive information stolen from the victim's device if the ransom is not paid.

Defending against cryptomalware involves implementing strong cybersecurity measures, such as using antivirus software, keeping software and systems up to date with security patches, and regularly backing up important files to an external device or cloud storage. It is also important to avoid clicking on suspicious links or downloading attachments from unknown sources, as these are common methods used to spread cryptomalware.

### Logic bombs

A logic bomb **is a type of malicious software or code that is designed to execute a specific action when certain conditions are met**. The action is usually destructive or disruptive, such as deleting files, stealing data, or causing a system to crash.

Unlike other types of malware, such as viruses or worms, logic bombs are typically triggered by a specific event or condition, rather than spreading autonomously. They can be installed on a system by a malicious insider or by an attacker who has gained unauthorized access.

Logic bombs can be difficult to detect because they are often dormant until triggered, and may not exhibit any unusual behavior until the trigger condition is met. They are typically designed to be difficult to remove or disarm, making them a potent weapon in the hands of a skilled attacker.

Some common trigger conditions for logic bombs include a specific date or time, the execution of a certain program or process, or the failure of a particular system component. Defending against logic bombs involves implementing strong access controls to prevent unauthorized installation, as well as regularly monitoring system behavior for signs of unusual activity or unexpected behavior.

### Spyware

Spyware **is a type of software that is designed to gather information from a computer or other electronic device without the user's knowledge or consent**. Spyware can be installed on a device through various means, including email attachments, software downloads, or exploiting security vulnerabilities.

Once installed, spyware can monitor a user's activity, such as their browsing history, keystrokes, and online transactions. It can also collect personal information, such as usernames, passwords, and credit card numbers, which can then be used for malicious purposes such as identity theft or financial fraud.

Some forms of spyware are designed to be difficult to detect and remove, and may continue to operate even after the infected device has been rebooted. To protect against spyware, it is important to use antivirus and antimalware software, avoid downloading software from untrusted sources, and keep operating systems and software up to date with the latest security patches.

### Keyloggers

Keyloggers, also known as keystroke loggers, **are a type of software or hardware device that is designed to capture and record every keystroke made on a computer or other electronic device**. This can include sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, and other personal data.

Keyloggers can be installed on a device through various means, including email attachments, software downloads, or exploiting security vulnerabilities. They can also be physically installed on a device through the use of hardware devices such as USB keyloggers.

Keyloggers can be used for both legitimate and malicious purposes. Legitimate uses of keyloggers include monitoring employee activity, tracking children's online activity, or detecting unauthorized access to a device. However, they can also be used for malicious purposes, such as stealing sensitive information or monitoring a victim's online activity without their knowledge.

To protect against keyloggers, it is important to use antivirus and antimalware software, avoid downloading software from untrusted sources, and keep operating systems and software up to date with the latest security patches. It is also important to use strong and unique passwords and to avoid entering sensitive information on public or unsecured networks.

### Remote access Trojan (RAT)

A Remote Access Trojan (RAT) **is a type of malware that allows an attacker to gain remote access and control over a victim's computer**. Once installed on a victim's device, a RAT can give an attacker complete access to the device, including the ability to view, modify, and delete files, capture keystrokes, record audio and video, and control the device's webcam and microphone.

RATs are typically spread through social engineering tactics, such as phishing emails, or by exploiting vulnerabilities in software or hardware. Once a victim's device is infected with a RAT, the attacker can control it remotely, often without the victim's knowledge.

RATs can be used for both legitimate and malicious purposes. Legitimate uses of RATs include remote administration and technical support, while malicious uses include stealing sensitive data, spying on users, and conducting distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks.

To protect against RATs, it is important to use antivirus and antimalware software, keep operating systems and software up to date with the latest security patches, and avoid downloading software from untrusted sources. It is also important to use strong and unique passwords and to avoid entering sensitive information on public or unsecured networks.

### Rootkit

A rootkit **is a type of malicious software designed to gain unauthorized access to a computer or system and to remain hidden from detection**. Once installed on a computer or system, a rootkit can allow an attacker to remotely control the system, steal sensitive information, and perform a wide range of other malicious activities.

Rootkits are typically installed through a variety of methods, including phishing attacks, software exploits, and social engineering tactics. Once installed, a rootkit can hide its presence by modifying the operating system's behavior or by redirecting system calls to hide its activities.

Some common techniques used by rootkits to hide their presence include modifying system files, altering the system's boot sequence, and intercepting system calls. By doing so, a rootkit can remain hidden from detection by antivirus and other security software.

Rootkits can be extremely difficult to detect and remove, and often require specialized tools and techniques to do so. To protect against rootkits, it is important to keep operating systems and software up to date with the latest security patches, avoid downloading software from untrusted sources, and use antivirus and antimalware software. It is also important to be vigilant for signs of suspicious activity on your computer or system, such as changes to system settings or the appearance of new or unknown files or programs.

### Backdoor

A backdoor **is a method of bypassing normal authentication and security mechanisms to gain unauthorized access to a computer system or network**. It is often installed by an attacker after gaining initial access to a system through other means, such as exploiting a vulnerability or tricking a user into installing malware. Once installed, a backdoor can allow an attacker to remotely control the compromised system, steal sensitive information, or launch additional attacks. Backdoors can be very difficult to detect and remove, and can remain active on a system for long periods of time if not discovered and addressed.

## Password Attacks

Password attacks are methods used by attackers to obtain passwords or gain unauthorized access to computer systems or networks. Password attacks can be very effective if proper security measures are not in place, and can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data or systems. It is important to use strong, unique passwords, enable two-factor authentication where possible, and be aware of phishing scams and other forms of social engineering.

### Spraying

Password spraying **is a type of brute-force attack in which an attacker uses a list of commonly used usernames and a single password or a small set of passwords to try to gain unauthorized access to a large number of user accounts**.

The goal of password spraying is to find weak or reused passwords, rather than guessing a specific user's password. This attack is often used against web-based applications or remote access services that allow access to a large number of users.

### Dictionary

A dictionary attack **is a type of password attack in which an attacker uses a pre-computed list of words, phrases, or other strings of characters** (known as a "*dictionary*") **to try to guess a user's password**.

The idea behind a dictionary attack is that many people use common words or phrases as their passwords, rather than random combinations of letters, numbers, and symbols. By using a dictionary of these common words and phrases, an attacker can quickly and efficiently guess many passwords.

A dictionary attack can be carried out manually or using automated tools, and it can be effective against weak passwords or passwords that use only lowercase letters or other predictable patterns. To defend against dictionary attacks, it's important to use strong, complex passwords that are not easily guessed by an attacker.

### Brute force

Brute force **password attacks are a type of password attack that involves trying every possible combination of characters until the correct password is found**. This method relies on sheer computing power to try all possible password combinations, typically starting with the most common passwords and moving on to less common ones. Brute force attacks can be time-consuming and resource-intensive, but they can be effective if the password is weak and relatively short. However, longer and more complex passwords can make brute force attacks much more difficult or even impractical.

Two types of brute force password attacks can be found:

- **Online** brute force password attacks are carried out in real-time and involve trying to guess a password by sending login attempts to a server or website. These attacks are limited by rate limits and other security measures put in place by the website or server, which can slow down the attack or even prevent it altogether.
- **Offline** brute force password attacks, on the other hand, are carried out on a stolen or leaked password database file that is not connected to the internet. Attackers can use specialized software to try all possible password combinations against the file, without being limited by rate limits or other security measures. This type of attack can be very effective, especially if the attackers have a powerful computer or a botnet at their disposal. However, obtaining a password database file is not easy, and it often requires a separate attack, such as a phishing or malware attack.

### Rainbow table

A rainbow table **is a precomputed table used for password cracking**. It contains a large number of potential password hashes and their corresponding plaintext passwords. Rainbow tables are used by attackers to quickly recover plaintext passwords from hashed passwords by looking them up in the table. This technique is particularly effective against weak passwords or passwords that are commonly used, as these can be easily cracked using precomputed tables. To counteract rainbow table attacks, stronger hashing algorithms and the use of salting have been recommended.

### Plaintext/unencrypted

Plaintext/unencrypted password **attacks refer to an attack in which an attacker gains access to a password that is stored in plain text or an unencrypted format**. This type of attack can occur when passwords are stored in a database, a configuration file, or any other location in which they can be accessed by someone with the right privileges or through a vulnerability in the system. Once an attacker has obtained a plaintext password, they can use it to gain access to the associated user account or system. This type of attack can be prevented by using encryption and secure password storage practices.

## Physical attacks

Physical attacks **refer to any type of attack that involves physical access to computer systems or other electronic devices**. These attacks can include theft of equipment, destruction or damage of hardware, or manipulation of hardware or software to gain unauthorized access.

### Malicious Universal Serial Bus (USB) cable

The Malicious Universal Serial Bus (USB) cable **physical attack involves the use of a specially designed USB cable to gain unauthorized access to a device or network**. The cable contains additional hardware, such as a microcontroller or wireless transmitter, that allows an attacker to remotely execute commands or extract data from the device. This type of attack is particularly dangerous because it can be difficult to detect and is often disguised as a legitimate cable.

### Malicious flash drive

A malicious flash drive **physical attack refers to the act of using a specially crafted USB flash drive to infiltrate a computer system or network**. The attacker may create a flash drive that contains malware or other malicious software designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the targeted system or network. Once the flash drive is inserted into a USB port, the malware can automatically execute, giving the attacker access to sensitive information, control of the system, or the ability to spread the malware to other connected devices. This type of physical attack is often used in combination with social engineering tactics, such as leaving the flash drive in a public location with the hope that someone will pick it up and insert it into their computer out of curiosity.

### Card cloning

Card cloning **is a physical attack in which an attacker uses a skimming device to steal data from the magnetic stripe of a credit or debit card**. The skimming device is usually placed over a legitimate card reader, such as an ATM or a gas pump, and captures the card information as it is swiped. The attacker can then use this information to create a cloned card or to make unauthorized purchases. Card cloning is a type of credit card fraud and can result in financial losses for the victim.

### Skimming

Skimming **is a physical attack that involves stealing credit or debit card information by using a device called a skimmer**. The skimmer is typically installed on a legitimate card reader, such as an ATM or gas pump, and it reads the information from the magnetic strip on the card when it is swiped. The information is then stored on the skimmer, and can later be used to create a counterfeit copy of the card or to make unauthorized purchases. Skimming is a form of credit card fraud, and can result in significant financial losses for victims.

## Adversarial artificial intelligence (AI)

Adversarial artificial intelligence (AI) **refers to the use of machine learning techniques to deceive or manipulate a model by intentionally inputting malicious data into the system**. Adversarial AI can be used to generate fake data or to modify legitimate data in such a way that it is misinterpreted by the machine learning model. This can result in incorrect decisions or actions being taken by the system, leading to security breaches, privacy violations, or other negative consequences. Adversarial AI is a growing concern in cybersecurity as machine learning models become more prevalent in various applications, including network intrusion detection, malware detection, and fraud detection.

### Tainted training data for machine learning (ML)

Tainted training data for machine learning (ML) **refers to data used to train a machine learning model that has been intentionally or unintentionally modified or manipulated to generate incorrect or biased results**. This can happen when the training data is incomplete, inaccurate, or biased towards a certain group, leading the machine learning model to make inaccurate predictions or decisions. Tainted training data can be intentionally created by attackers to manipulate machine learning models and cause harm, such as in adversarial attacks, or it can occur accidentally due to poor data quality or biased selection of training data. It is a significant concern in machine learning and artificial intelligence applications that rely on accurate and unbiased data to make decisions.

### Security of machine learning algorithms

Security of machine learning (ML) algorithms is an emerging area of concern in the field of cybersecurity. ML algorithms are being increasingly used in a wide range of applications, such as image recognition, natural language processing, and fraud detection. However, these algorithms are vulnerable to a range of security threats, including adversarial attacks, data poisoning, and model stealing.

Adversarial attacks are a type of attack in which an attacker intentionally manipulates the input data to cause the ML algorithm to produce incorrect results. These attacks can be carried out through a range of techniques, such as adding noise to the input data or modifying the input data in subtle ways.

Data poisoning is another type of attack in which an attacker manipulates the training data used to train the ML algorithm. By inserting malicious data into the training dataset, an attacker can influence the output of the ML algorithm in a way that benefits them.

Model stealing is a type of attack in which an attacker attempts to steal the ML model itself. This can be done by analyzing the input-output behavior of the model, or by using a technique known as model inversion to reverse-engineer the model from its output.

To address these security threats, researchers are developing a range of techniques for securing ML algorithms, such as detecting and mitigating adversarial attacks, detecting data poisoning attacks, and protecting the ML model from theft. These techniques involve a range of approaches, such as developing more robust ML algorithms, designing better training datasets, and using techniques such as encryption to protect the ML model from theft.

## Supply-chain attacks

Supply-chain attacks, also known as third-party attacks, **are a type of cyberattack that target vulnerabilities in the software and hardware supply chain**. The attackers compromise one or more elements of the supply chain, such as a software vendor or a hardware manufacturer, and inject malicious code or components into the final product or service. This allows the attackers to gain unauthorized access, steal data, or cause damage to the targeted organization or individuals using the compromised product or service.

Supply-chain attacks are a growing concern for cybersecurity professionals because they are difficult to detect and mitigate. They can also have widespread and long-lasting consequences, as the compromised product or service may be used by multiple organizations or individuals. Examples of supply-chain attacks include the NotPetya ransomware attack, the SolarWinds attack, and the recent Kaseya ransomware attack.

## Cloud-based vs. on-premises attacks

Cloud-based and on-premises attacks **refer to different ways in which cyber attacks can be carried out, depending on the location of the target systems and data.**

On-premises attacks refer to attacks that are carried out against systems and data that are located within an organization's own physical premises, such as a data center or a server room. These types of attacks typically involve attempts to breach an organization's internal network security, such as by exploiting vulnerabilities in software or by using social engineering techniques to trick employees into divulging sensitive information.

Cloud-based attacks, on the other hand, target systems and data that are located in cloud environments, such as those provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform. These types of attacks can take many forms, including attempts to exploit vulnerabilities in cloud services, phishing attacks targeting cloud-based accounts and credentials, and attacks aimed at hijacking cloud-based virtual machines.

Both on-premises and cloud-based attacks can have serious consequences for organizations, including theft of sensitive data, disruption of critical business processes, and damage to the organization's reputation. As such, it is important for organizations to implement robust security measures to protect against both types of attacks, such as strong access controls, regular security assessments, and employee training programs to prevent social engineering attacks.

## Cryptographic attacks

Cryptographic attacks are methods used by attackers to exploit weaknesses or vulnerabilities in cryptographic systems or algorithms to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or information. These attacks may involve analyzing the cryptographic keys, algorithms, or protocols used to secure data transmission, storage, or communication to find weaknesses that can be exploited to decrypt, modify, or otherwise compromise the integrity or confidentiality of the data.

These attacks can be used to crack passwords, intercept encrypted communications, steal confidential information, or compromise the security of authentication mechanisms used to control access to critical systems or networks. To prevent such attacks, it is important to use strong encryption algorithms, secure key management, and implement best practices for secure data transmission, storage, and communication.

### Birthday

In cryptography, a birthday is a phenomenon where the probability of two people sharing the same birthday is higher than expected in a group of people. Similarly, a birthday attack **is a cryptographic attack that takes advantage of this phenomenon to find two inputs that generate the same hash value**.

In a cryptographic hash function, the output (hash) has a fixed size, regardless of the size of the input. This means that different inputs can produce the same hash value. In a birthday attack, the attacker tries to find two inputs that produce the same hash value by generating a large number of random inputs (often using a brute-force approach) and checking if any two of them have the same hash value.

A birthday attack can be used to attack cryptographic protocols that use hash functions, such as digital signatures or message authentication codes (MACs). If an attacker can find two messages that produce the same hash value, they can create a fraudulent digital signature or MAC, which can be used to impersonate the legitimate sender or receiver of a message.

### Collision

In cryptografy, a collision **refers to the situation where two different input values** (such as two different plaintext messages) **produce the same output value** (such as the same hash value). In other words, a collision occurs when a cryptographic hash function generates the same output for two different inputs.

Collisions are considered a weakness in cryptographic hash functions because they can be used by attackers to generate fraudulent data or to deceive a system that relies on the integrity of hash values for data verification. In practice, collisions can be exploited to bypass authentication mechanisms, create counterfeit digital signatures, or break digital certificates.

Cryptographic hash functions are designed to be resistant to collisions through the use of complex mathematical algorithms that generate unique hash values for each input. However, some hash functions are more vulnerable to collision attacks than others, and researchers are constantly working to develop stronger hash functions that are less susceptible to such attacks.

### Downgrade

In cryptograpy, a downgrade attack **is a type of attack that exploits vulnerabilities in communication protocols to force a system to use weaker cryptographic algorithms or protocols than it would normally use**. This makes it easier for attackers to intercept and decode sensitive information that is being transmitted over the network.

Downgrade attacks can be particularly effective when used against systems that are not configured to detect or prevent such attacks, and they can be used in a variety of contexts, including web applications, email systems, and virtual private networks (VPNs).
