# 1.4 Given a scenario, analyze potential indicators associated with network attacks.

## Wireless

Wireless attacks **refer to various methods of exploiting vulnerabilities in wireless networks, including Wi-Fi networks, Bluetooth, and cellular networks, to gain unauthorized access or disrupt network operations**. Wireless attacks can be carried out by attackers in close proximity to the target network or from a remote location using specialized tools and techniques.

### Evil twin

The evil twin wireless attack **is a type of wireless attack where an attacker sets up a fake wireless access point (AP) that appears to be a legitimate one**. The fake AP has the same name and appears to be broadcasting from the same location as the legitimate one, tricking users into connecting to it instead. Once a user connects to the fake AP, the attacker can intercept and capture the user's network traffic, steal sensitive information, or launch other attacks such as malware injection or phishing. This attack can be carried out by creating a rogue wireless network with a similar name and tricking users into connecting to it or by setting up a wireless AP that broadcasts the same SSID as a legitimate one. It is an example of a man-in-the-middle attack.

### Rogue access point

A rogue access point attack **is a wireless attack where an attacker sets up a wireless access point (AP) that appears to be legitimate but is actually controlled by the attacker**. The rogue access point is typically set up in a public area, such as a coffee shop or hotel lobby, where unsuspecting users connect to the internet through the rogue AP. Once a user connects to the rogue AP, the attacker can intercept and manipulate their network traffic, steal sensitive information such as login credentials, or spread malware to the user's device. This type of attack can be especially effective in environments where users are accustomed to connecting to public Wi-Fi networks without taking proper security precautions.

### Bluesnarfing

Bluesnarfing **is a type of wireless attack that involves gaining unauthorized access to a Bluetooth-enabled device, such as a smartphone or laptop, to steal information or access sensitive data**. This attack can occur when the device's Bluetooth connection is left on and set to "*discoverable*" mode, allowing an attacker to connect to the device without the user's knowledge. Once connected, the attacker can access the device's data and even take control of the device, potentially allowing them to install malware or spyware. Bluesnarfing can be prevented by disabling Bluetooth when it is not in use and setting it to "*non-discoverable*" mode.

### Bluejacking

Bluejacking **is a type of wireless attack that involves sending unsolicited messages or data over Bluetooth to a Bluetooth-enabled device such as a smartphone, laptop, or tablet**. The attacker can use the device's Bluetooth connection to send unwanted messages, typically for spamming or harassment purposes. The messages are usually harmless and can be easily ignored, but in some cases, the attacker can use Bluejacking as a means to deliver malware or phishing attempts. Bluejacking does not involve hacking into the device or accessing any sensitive information; it is simply a nuisance for the victim.

### Disassociation

A disassociation attack **is a type of wireless attack in which an attacker sends forged disassociation packets to a wireless access point or a client device on a wireless network**. The disassociation packet causes the access point or client to disconnect from the wireless network, which can result in a denial-of-service (DoS) attack or allow the attacker to capture sensitive information.

The disassociation attack exploits a weakness in the IEEE 802.11 wireless protocol, which defines how wireless devices communicate with each other. Specifically, the attack abuses the fact that an attacker can send a forged disassociation packet to a wireless device without being authenticated to the wireless network.

By disconnecting a device from the network, an attacker can prevent legitimate users from accessing network resources or cause disruptions in network traffic. In some cases, a disassociation attack can also be used to capture sensitive information by tricking a client device to connect to a rogue access point set up by the attacker.

### Jamming

Jamming **is a type of wireless attack that involves the deliberate interference with wireless signals in order to disrupt communications**. This can be done using a variety of techniques, such as flooding the airwaves with noise, sending signals on the same frequency as the intended communication, or transmitting a high-powered signal that overwhelms the receiver. Jamming can be used to disrupt wireless networks, prevent users from accessing network resources, and even cause physical damage to wireless devices in some cases. It is considered a form of denial-of-service (DoS) attack, as it aims to deny legitimate users access to a wireless network or resource. Jamming is illegal in most jurisdictions and is often used by attackers to carry out malicious activities such as theft, espionage, or terrorism.

### Radio frequency identification (RFID)

Radio frequency identification (RFID) **is a wireless technology that uses radio waves to automatically identify and track objects**. It involves small electronic devices, called RFID tags, that contain a unique identifier and are attached to or embedded within items. These tags communicate with RFID readers or antennas to transmit and receive information. RFID technology has many applications in various industries, including inventory management, supply chain management, and asset tracking. However, it also poses security risks, as RFID tags can be used for tracking and surveillance purposes, and the communication between the tags and readers can be intercepted and manipulated by attackers.

### Near-field communication (NFC)

Near-field communication (NFC) **is a wireless communication technology that allows two electronic devices, typically a mobile device and a NFC-enabled tag or reader, to establish communication when they are brought in close proximity**, usually within a few centimeters of each other. It is a short-range communication technology that operates at a frequency of 13.56 MHz and uses electromagnetic induction to transmit information between devices. NFC is commonly used for contactless payment, access control, and data transfer between devices. It is often considered to be more secure than other wireless communication technologies such as Bluetooth because of its short range and the need for physical proximity.

### Initialization vector (IV)

An initialization vector (IV) **is a fixed-size input used in conjunction with a cryptographic algorithm to enhance the security of encrypted messages**. The IV is typically a random or pseudo-random value that is used to initialize the state of the encryption algorithm before encryption begins. The IV is used to introduce additional randomness into the encryption process, making it more difficult for an attacker to decrypt the encrypted message by brute force or other methods. The IV must be kept secret and shared between the sender and receiver of the encrypted message. However, weaknesses in the generation or management of IVs can lead to vulnerabilities in the security of wireless networks. For example, in the case of WEP, weak IVs were one of the factors that made the protocol vulnerable to attack.

## On-path attack

On-path attack, also known as man-in-the-middle attack (MITM)/man-in-the-browser attack (MITB), **is a type of cyber attack where an attacker intercepts and alters the communication between two parties without either party's knowledge**. The attacker is able to monitor the communication and can even modify it for their own purposes, such as stealing sensitive information like login credentials or credit card numbers. On-path attacks are often conducted through the use of various techniques, such as session hijacking, ARP spoofing, DNS spoofing, and SSL stripping.

## Layer 2 attacks

Layer 2 attacks, also known as data link layer attacks, **are a type of network attack that targets the data link layer of the OSI model**, which is responsible for the transmission of data packets between two adjacent network nodes over a physical connection. These attacks involve manipulating or exploiting weaknesses in the data link layer protocols to intercept, modify, or block data packets, redirect traffic to unauthorized destinations, or conduct other malicious activities.

### Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) poisoning

Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) poisoning, also known as ARP spoofing, **is a type of attack in which an attacker sends falsified ARP messages over a local area network (LAN) to link the attacker's MAC address with the IP address of another network device on the LAN**. This can allow the attacker to intercept, modify, or even stop network traffic between the two devices. ARP poisoning can be used to launch other types of attacks, such as man-in-the-middle attacks, denial-of-service attacks, or session hijacking attacks. ARP poisoning can be prevented by using secure ARP protocols or by implementing measures such as static ARP tables, ARP spoofing detection software, or cryptographic network protocols.

### Media access control (MAC) flooding

Media Access Control (MAC) flooding **is a network attack in which an attacker sends a large number of frames with different MAC addresses to a switch**. The purpose of this attack is to overload the switch's content-addressable memory (CAM) table, which is used to map MAC addresses to switch ports. Once the CAM table is full, the switch will start to broadcast frames to all ports, rather than forwarding them only to the intended destination port. This can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, as well as allow the attacker to intercept or manipulate network traffic.

### MAC cloning

MAC cloning **is the process of copying the Media Access Control (MAC) address of one device and assigning it to another device**. It is often used to bypass network security measures that filter traffic based on the MAC address of a device. By cloning the MAC address of an authorized device, an attacker can gain access to a network or system that would otherwise be blocked.

## Domain name system (DNS)

Domain Name System (DNS) **is a hierarchical decentralized naming system that translates human-readable domain names into numerical IP addresses that machines can use to identify and communicate with each other on the internet**. It functions like a phone book for the internet, enabling users to access websites and other online services by typing in a domain name (such as [www.example.com](http://www.example.com/)) instead of the numerical IP address (such as 93.184.216.34) associated with that website. The DNS system is critical to the functioning of the internet, and it relies on a distributed network of servers to handle the translation of domain names to IP addresses.

### Domain hijacking

Domain hijacking, also known as domain theft, **is the unauthorized takeover of a domain name without the consent of the domain owner**. It is a type of cyber attack in which an attacker gains access to the domain name account of the legitimate owner and takes control of the domain name by changing its registration information. The attacker can then redirect traffic meant for the legitimate domain to a fake website, steal sensitive information, or use the domain for malicious purposes. This can have severe consequences for the legitimate owner, including loss of business, reputation damage, and financial losses.

### DNS poisoning

DNS poisoning, also known as cache poisoning, **is a type of cyber attack where a hacker corrupts the Domain Name System (DNS) server's cache by altering the IP address mapping for a domain name**. This allows the attacker to redirect users to a malicious website without their knowledge or consent.

For example, a hacker could modify the DNS server's cache for a legitimate banking website, directing users who attempt to visit the site to a fake site that looks similar to the real one. The fake site could then steal the user's login credentials and other sensitive information.

DNS poisoning can occur in a variety of ways, including exploiting vulnerabilities in the DNS server software, intercepting DNS requests, or redirecting traffic through a compromised router or switch. The attack can be especially effective if the attacker can poison the DNS cache of a popular website or a widely used DNS server.

### Uniform Resource Locator (URL) redirection

URL redirection **is a technique used in web development to make a web page available under more than one URL address**. This technique can also be used maliciously as a type of attack known as URL redirection or URL forwarding. In this attack, an attacker crafts a malicious URL that redirects the user to a fake website or a website that the attacker controls. The user is often lured to click on the URL through phishing emails, social engineering, or other means. Once the user clicks on the URL, they are redirected to the attacker's website, where their personal information may be harvested, or they may be tricked into downloading malware.

### Domain reputation

Domain reputation **refers to the assessment of a domain's trustworthiness or legitimacy based on various factors** such as domain age, history of malicious activity associated with the domain, and the reputation of the IP addresses associated with the domain. A domain with a poor reputation may be associated with spamming, phishing, malware, or other forms of malicious activity, and can result in blocking by spam filters or blacklists. Domain reputation is an important consideration in evaluating the safety and trustworthiness of websites and online services.

## Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS)

A Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack **is a type of cyber attack that attempts to disrupt the normal functioning of a targeted server, website, or network by overwhelming it with a flood of traffic from multiple sources**. This is accomplished by using a network of infected computers or "*botnet*" to flood the target with a high volume of traffic, rendering it unable to handle legitimate requests from users. DDoS attacks can be launched for various reasons, including extortion, revenge, or as a form of activism, and can cause significant damage to the targeted organization by disrupting business operations, causing financial losses, and damaging its reputation.

The three main types of DDoS attacks are:

1.  **Network-layer DDoS attacks**: In this type of DDoS attack, the attacker targets the network infrastructure of the victim, flooding the network with a high volume of traffic that causes the network to slow down or become unavailable. These attacks can be conducted using a variety of techniques, including UDP flooding, ICMP flooding, SYN flooding, and DNS amplification.
2.  **Application-layer DDoS attacks**: In this type of DDoS attack, the attacker targets the web applications or servers of the victim, exploiting vulnerabilities in the application layer to cause a denial-of-service. These attacks are more difficult to detect and mitigate, as they mimic legitimate traffic and require deep packet inspection to detect.
3.  **Operational technology (OT) DDoS attacks**: This type of DDoS attack targets the control systems and devices used in operational technology (OT) environments such as industrial control systems (ICS) and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems. The attack can lead to a disruption of the normal operation of critical infrastructure or other processes that rely on OT devices.

### Malicious code or script execution

Malicious code or script execution **is a type of cyber attack where an attacker injects harmful code into a computer system to gain unauthorized access or to cause damage to the system**. Malicious code can take many forms, including viruses, worms, Trojans, spyware, adware, ransomware, and more. Once the code is executed, it can perform a variety of harmful actions, such as stealing sensitive information, damaging files, or controlling the computer remotely. Malicious code can be spread through various means, including email attachments, software downloads, and infected websites. The consequences of a successful malicious code attack can be severe, including financial loss, reputational damage, and legal liability.

Security professionals should be familiar with scripting and compiled languages, and how they can be used to execute malicious code. In addition, they should also be familiar with techniques used to prevent or mitigate the execution of malicious code. This includes techniques such as code signing, whitelisting, and sandboxing, as well as good coding practices such as input validation and error checking.
