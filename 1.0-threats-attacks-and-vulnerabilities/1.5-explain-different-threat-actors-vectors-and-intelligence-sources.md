# 1.5 Explain different threat actors, vectors, and intelligence sources.

## Actors and threats

Actors refer to individuals or entities that pose a threat to an organization's assets or systems. While, threats refer to actions or events that have the potential to cause harm to an organization's assets or systems.

### Advanced persistent threat (APT)

An Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) **is a stealthy, targeted attack by an adversary, typically a nation-state or other well-resourced attacker, who gains unauthorized access to a network or system and remains undetected for an extended period**. APT attacks involve a series of carefully planned and orchestrated steps that allow attackers to gain access to a target network or system, move laterally through the network, escalate privileges, and maintain persistence. APT attacks often involve sophisticated techniques, such as social engineering, zero-day exploits, and custom malware, and are designed to compromise high-value targets, such as government agencies, military organizations, critical infrastructure, and large corporations. APT attacks are typically motivated by espionage, theft of intellectual property, or sabotage, and can cause significant damage to an organization's reputation, finances, and operations.

### Insider threats

Insider threats **refer to the risks and vulnerabilities that arise from individuals who have authorized access to an organization's assets or information**, such as employees, contractors, or business partners. Insider threats may occur when these individuals misuse their access privileges or intentionally or unintentionally cause harm to the organization's information security. Examples of insider threats include stealing or selling confidential information, installing malware, sabotaging systems or data, or simply making errors that cause security breaches. Insiders can be both malicious and unintentional, making them a complex and difficult challenge for organizations to manage and mitigate.

### State actors

State actors **are individuals, groups, or organizations that operate on behalf of a nation-state or government**. They may carry out attacks or espionage to achieve political, economic, or military objectives on behalf of their government. State actors often have extensive resources, technical expertise, and support from their government, making them a significant threat to national security and critical infrastructure. Examples of state actors include intelligence agencies, military organizations, and diplomatic corps.

### Hacktivists

Hacktivists **refer to a type of threat actor who uses their hacking skills and tools to achieve political or social goals**. They are typically motivated by their ideology or belief system and use cyberattacks to promote their agenda or to bring attention to a particular cause or issue. Hacktivists may target government organizations, corporations, or other entities that they believe are engaging in unethical or illegal practices. They may also engage in cyber protests or defacements of websites to promote their message. Examples of hacktivist groups include Anonymous and LulzSec.

### Script kiddies

Script kiddies **are individuals who use automated tools and pre-written scripts to carry out cyber attacks, rather than creating their own tools or techniques**. They often have limited technical knowledge and rely on readily available hacking tools and exploits to launch attacks. Script kiddies may be motivated by a desire for notoriety or attention, or they may engage in hacking activities for personal gain or to advance political or social causes. While they may not pose as significant a threat as more sophisticated attackers, script kiddies can still cause damage and disruption, particularly to vulnerable or poorly secured systems.

### Criminal syndicates

Criminal syndicates **refer to organized groups of criminals or crime organizations that operate to engage in illegal activities** such as drug trafficking, human trafficking, money laundering, fraud, and cybercrime. These groups may be comprised of individuals from different backgrounds and may have a hierarchical structure with specific roles and responsibilities. Criminal syndicates often use violence and intimidation tactics to maintain control and expand their criminal activities. In the context of cybercrime, criminal syndicates may engage in activities such as ransomware attacks, phishing scams, and stealing personal and financial information for financial gain.

### Hackers

Hackers **are individuals or groups with advanced computer skills and knowledge of how to exploit vulnerabilities in computer systems and networks for various purposes**, including gaining unauthorized access to sensitive information or disrupting systems.

As a simple classification can be:

**- Black hat/Unauthorized hackers**, also known as "*crackers*," use their skills for malicious purposes, such as stealing sensitive data, distributing malware, or causing damage to systems or networks.
**- White hat/Authorized hackers**, also known as "*ethical hackers*," use their skills for legitimate purposes, such as identifying and reporting vulnerabilities to improve security.
**- Grey hat/Semi-authorized hackers** are somewhere in between black and white hats, using their skills for both ethical and unethical purposes, often without malicious intent but without proper authorization.

It's important to note that these categories are not necessarily fixed, and an individual may move between them based on their actions and motivations.

### Shadow IT

Shadow IT **refers to the use of information technology (IT) systems, software, devices, or services within an organization that are not approved or managed by the IT department**. This can include the use of personal devices, applications, or cloud services to store or access company data without proper authorization or security measures. Shadow IT can pose significant security risks, as it often involves the use of unsupported or unsecured technologies that can be vulnerable to cyber attacks or data breaches.

### Competitors

Competitors **refer to other businesses or organizations that are competing with a particular company in the marketplace**. Competitors can potentially pose a threat to a company's cybersecurity through various means, such as attempting to steal intellectual property, customer data, or sensitive business information. In some cases, competitors may engage in corporate espionage or other illegal activities to gain an advantage in the marketplace. Therefore, it is important for companies to have appropriate security measures in place to protect their assets from competitors and other potential threats.

## Attributes of actors

Attributes of actors **refer to the characteristics or traits that describe threat actors who carry out cyberattacks**. Some common attributes of actors include their level of access, sophistication, resources, motivation, and objectives. Here is a brief overview of each attribute:

- **Access**: This refers to the leve of authorized access to an organization's systems. Actors can be internal or external, this distinction is important in determining the potential damage that they can cause, as well as the potential motives for their actions. In addition, where they are geographically located can be relevant in determining the jurisdiction and legal framework that applies to their actions, as well as the potential motives and resources available to them.
- **Sophistication**: This refers to the technical skills and knowledge of an actor when it comes to carrying out cyberattacks. Highly sophisticated actors have advanced technical expertise and are capable of developing custom malware and other tools to evade detection.
- **Resources/funding**: This refers to the funding, infrastructure, and tools that an actor has at their disposal to carry out cyberattacks. Actors with greater resources can launch more complex and sustained attacks.
- **Intent/motivation**: This refers to the reason why an actor is carrying out cyberattacks. Motivations can range from financial gain to political or ideological reasons, and can influence the types of targets and methods used.
- **Objectives**: This refers to the specific goals that an actor is trying to achieve through their cyberattacks. Objectives can include stealing sensitive data, disrupting business operations, or gaining access to critical infrastructure.

## Vectors

Attack vectors **refer to the various ways in which an attacker can gain unauthorized access to a system or network**. These can include both technical and non-technical methods of attack, such as:

1.  **Malware**: Attackers can use malware to gain access to a system or network, steal data, or disrupt operations. Malware can be delivered through email attachments, infected software, or through malicious websites.
2.  **Social Engineering**: Social engineering involves manipulating individuals into divulging sensitive information or performing actions that enable the attacker to gain access to a system or network. This can include techniques such as phishing, pretexting, or baiting.
3.  **Password attacks**: Password attacks involve attempting to guess or steal a user's login credentials. Attackers can use various methods, including brute force attacks, dictionary attacks, or keylogging.

5.  **Physical attacks**: Physical attacks involve physically accessing a system or network, either through theft or by gaining unauthorized access to a physical location.
6.  **Supply Chain Attacks**: Supply chain attacks involve attacking third-party vendors or suppliers that provide products or services to the targeted organization. This can include methods such as software supply chain attacks, hardware supply chain attacks, or service provider attacks.
7.  **Wireless Attacks**: Wireless attacks involve exploiting vulnerabilities in wireless networks to gain unauthorized access to a system or network. These can include methods such as rogue access points, evil twin attacks, and wireless sniffing.
8.  **Insider Attacks**: Insider attacks involve individuals who have authorized access to a system or network, but use that access for malicious purposes. This can include actions such as stealing data, introducing malware, or disrupting operations.

## Threat intelligence sources

Threat intelligence sources **refer to the information that can be gathered from various sources to identify and understand potential threats to an organization's security posture**. These sources may include open-source intelligence, commercial threat intelligence services, government intelligence agencies, and other relevant sources.

Threat intelligence sources may also include internal sources such as security logs, incident reports, and vulnerability assessments conducted within the organization. Additionally, threat intelligence may be gathered through partnerships and collaborations with other organizations in the same industry or with similar security concerns.

### Open-source intelligence (OSINT)

Open-source intelligence (OSINT) **refers to information that is publicly available and can be collected from open sources, such as social media platforms, news articles, blogs, and other public websites**. OSINT can be used by organizations or individuals to gain insights into potential threats, risks, or vulnerabilities. It can also be used to gather intelligence about a particular target or subject. OSINT is typically collected through automated tools and manual research, and it can be used in combination with other sources of intelligence to form a comprehensive understanding of a situation.

### Closed/proprietary intelligence

Closed or proprietary intelligence **refers to information that is not publicly available and is typically owned and controlled by a specific organization**. This type of intelligence is often gathered through internal monitoring and analysis of an organization's own networks, systems, and applications, as well as by using various security technologies and tools. Closed/proprietary intelligence can also be obtained through partnerships with other organizations, sharing of threat intelligence among industry peers, and by purchasing commercial intelligence services. The main goal of closed/proprietary intelligence is to provide organizations with specific and relevant information about threats and vulnerabilities that could potentially impact their operations and assets.

### Vulnerability databases

Vulnerability databases are repositories that contain information about known vulnerabilities in software, operating systems, and other technology systems. These databases provide detailed information about the nature of the vulnerabilities, including the potential impact on the affected systems, the severity of the vulnerability, and the affected versions or products. They may also provide guidance on how to mitigate or remediate the vulnerabilities, such as recommended patches or workarounds. Examples of popular vulnerability databases include the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE), and the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Top 10.

### Public/private information-sharing centers

Public/private information-sharing centers **are organizations that facilitate the sharing of cybersecurity information among different entities such as private companies, government agencies, and non-profit organizations**. These centers act as a central point where information related to cyber threats, vulnerabilities, and incidents can be collected, analyzed, and shared with relevant parties. They serve as a means for improving situational awareness, enabling better incident response, and enhancing overall cybersecurity posture. Examples of public information-sharing centers include the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the National Cyber-Forensics and Training Alliance (NCFTA), while examples of private information-sharing centers include the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center (FS-ISAC) and the Retail Cyber Intelligence Sharing Center (R-CISC).

### Dark Web

The dark web **refers to a part of the internet that is not indexed or searchable through conventional search engines**. It is also known as the "darknet" and requires special software, configurations, or authorization to access. The dark web is often associated with illegal activities, such as the sale of drugs, weapons, stolen data, and other illicit goods and services. It is also a popular platform for cybercriminals to communicate, exchange information and tools, and conduct various cyber attacks, including DDoS attacks, phishing, and malware distribution.

### Indicators of compromise

Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) **are pieces of forensic evidence that indicate a potential intrusion into a network or system**. They can be used to detect or investigate security incidents and can include various artifacts such as network traffic, system logs, file system activity, and suspicious behavior patterns. IoCs are typically collected and analyzed by security teams to identify patterns and indicators of malicious activity, and are often shared among organizations to improve collective defense against cyber threats. Common examples of IoCs include IP addresses, domain names, hashes of malicious files, and patterns of command and control traffic.

### Automated Indicator Sharing (AIS)

Automated Indicator Sharing (AIS) **is a system that enables the automated exchange of threat intelligence between different organizations**. It allows for the sharing of information on Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) and other relevant threat intelligence, such as the Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) used by threat actors.

Structured Threat Information eXpression (**STIX**) and Trusted Automated eXchange of Intelligence Information (**TAXII**) are two standards used in the implementation of AIS. STIX provides a standardized language for describing cyber threat information, while TAXII provides a framework for the exchange of that information between different organizations. Together, STIX and TAXII allow for the automated sharing of threat intelligence in a structured and consistent format.

### Predictive analysis

Predictive analysis **is a technique used in cybersecurity to forecast potential future events and trends based on historical data, statistical algorithms, and machine learning models**. It involves analyzing large datasets to identify patterns and relationships, and then using this information to predict possible outcomes. In the context of cybersecurity, predictive analysis can help identify potential threats and vulnerabilities, and enable organizations to take proactive measures to prevent or mitigate the impact of these threats. This approach can be particularly useful in identifying emerging threats, such as new malware variants or attack methods, and in predicting potential attack targets.

### Threat maps

Threat maps **are visual representations that display cybersecurity threats and attacks on a map or other geographical display**. They allow users to see the location and frequency of cyber attacks in real-time or over a period of time. Threat maps can also show the severity of the attack, the type of attack, and the source of the attack. They are commonly used by security analysts and organizations to monitor and track potential threats and to identify patterns or trends in cyber attacks. Threat maps can also help organizations to understand the threat landscape and to develop strategies for mitigating cyber risks.

### File/code repositories

File/code repositories **are online platforms that allow developers to store and manage their source code and related files**. These repositories are often used for collaboration, allowing multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously. They also provide version control features, allowing developers to track changes to their code over time and revert to previous versions if necessary. Some popular file/code repositories include GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket. These repositories can be a valuable source of information for threat intelligence, as they may contain indicators of compromise or other evidence of malicious activity.
