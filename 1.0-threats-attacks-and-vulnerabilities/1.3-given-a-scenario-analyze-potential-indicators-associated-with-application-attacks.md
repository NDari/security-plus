# 1.3 Given a scenario, analyze potential indicators associated with application attacks.

## Privilege escalation

Privilege escalation **refers to the act of exploiting a vulnerability or a weakness in a system or application to gain higher levels of access or permissions than originally intended or authorized**. This could allow an attacker to gain administrative or root-level access to a system, giving them complete control over it and the ability to carry out malicious actions such as stealing sensitive data, modifying or deleting files, or installing malware. Privilege escalation attacks can occur due to misconfigurations, software vulnerabilities, or weaknesses in access controls. It is a common technique used by attackers to gain more extensive control over a compromised system or network.

## Cross-site scripting

Cross-site scripting (XSS) **is a type of security vulnerability found in web applications that enables an attacker to inject client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users**. XSS attacks occur when an attacker injects malicious code, typically in the form of a script written in JavaScript or HTML, into a vulnerable web page. When a user visits the compromised web page, the script executes within the user's web browser, allowing the attacker to steal data, modify or delete web page content, or take control of the user's session on the vulnerable website.

XSS attacks can take different forms, including **reflected XSS**, **stored XSS**, and **DOM-based XSS**, and can be classified as either **persistent or non-persistent**. Persistent XSS involves injecting malicious code that is permanently stored on the target web server and executed every time a user visits a vulnerable page. Non-persistent XSS involves injecting malicious code that is only temporarily stored on the target server and executed when a user visits a specific, compromised URL.

Preventing XSS attacks typically involves input validation and output encoding to ensure that user-supplied data is not executed as code in the user's web browser. Other strategies include the use of content security policies and the implementation of measures to prevent unauthorized access to cookies or session tokens.

## Injections

In the context of cybersecurity, an injection **is a type of attack where an attacker injects malicious code or data into a vulnerable software application or system**. The term "*injection*" refers to the attacker injecting (i.e., inserting) the malicious code or data into the application or system.

There are several types of injection attacks, including SQL injection, command injection, and LDAP injection. In SQL injection, the attacker injects malicious SQL code into a vulnerable web application's input field. The injected SQL code can then access or manipulate the application's database. In command injection, the attacker injects malicious code into a command that is executed by the application or system. In LDAP injection, the attacker injects malicious data into an LDAP search query to extract sensitive information.

### Structured query language (SQL)

SQL injection **is a type of injection attack that targets database-driven web applications.** It occurs when an attacker inserts malicious SQL code into a web form or query string, tricking the application into executing unintended actions such as reading, modifying, or deleting data stored in the database. The attack can result in data theft, data loss, or unauthorized access to sensitive information. SQL injection attacks can be prevented by using parameterized queries or prepared statements to sanitize user input and validate data before passing it to the database.

### Dynamic-link library (DLL)

Dynamic-link library (DLL) injection **is a type of cyber attack where an attacker injects malicious code into a running process by inserting a malicious DLL into the process's address space**. DLL injection can be used to perform various malicious activities, such as stealing sensitive information, modifying system settings, or executing arbitrary code. This attack can be executed through several means, including exploiting software vulnerabilities, social engineering, or through the use of malicious email attachments or downloads. Once the malicious code has been injected into the process, the attacker gains control over the system and can execute any command or access any data that the compromised process has access to.

### Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)

Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) injection **is a type of injection attack that targets LDAP databases or directories**, which are used to store information about users, groups, and other objects within an organization. In an LDAP injection attack, an attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the input validation of an application that uses LDAP to query or update an LDAP directory. The attacker injects malicious LDAP statements into the application's input fields to gain unauthorized access to the LDAP directory, extract sensitive data, or modify the directory's content. LDAP injection attacks can result in serious consequences, such as data theft, data tampering, or unauthorized access to critical systems or applications.

### Extensible Markup Language (XML)

XML injection **is a type of security vulnerability that can occur when user input is not properly sanitized in applications that process XML data**. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious XML code into an XML document or data stream, which can then be executed by the application or passed on to other systems. The injected code can be used to steal sensitive information, manipulate or delete data, or take control of the application or system. To prevent XML injection, it is important to properly validate and sanitize user input and use secure coding practices when working with XML data.

## Pointer/object dereference

Pointer/Object dereference, also known as a pointer/reference vulnerability, **is a type of software vulnerability that occurs when an application does not properly validate or sanitize user-supplied input before using it as a memory address or object reference**. This can allow an attacker to manipulate the input in such a way that the program ends up accessing or modifying memory locations or objects it shouldn't have access to, potentially leading to a range of security issues, such as information disclosure, denial of service, or remote code execution. Pointer/Object dereference vulnerabilities are commonly found in low-level programming languages like C and C++, but can also occur in other languages.

## Directory traversal

Directory traversal, also known as path traversal, **is a type of web application vulnerability that allows an attacker to access files and directories outside the intended directory tree**. This can occur when a web application does not properly sanitize user input, which allows an attacker to use special characters and sequences to navigate up and down the directory structure. This can lead to sensitive information disclosure, unauthorized access to files, and in some cases, execution of malicious code. Directory traversal attacks can be prevented by implementing proper input validation and sanitization techniques.

## Buffer overflows

A buffer overflow **is a type of software vulnerability that can occur when a program tries to write more data to a buffer** (temporary storage area in memory) **than it can actually hold**. When this happens, the extra data can overwrite adjacent memory areas, potentially causing the program to behave unexpectedly or crash.

Buffer overflow attacks can be used by malicious actors to take control of a program or a system, and they can be particularly dangerous when they allow attackers to execute arbitrary code. Because buffer overflows can be difficult to detect and can occur in a wide range of software, they have been a common technique used by hackers to exploit vulnerabilities in software applications. As a result, software developers and security professionals work to identify and patch buffer overflow vulnerabilities as part of their efforts to secure software and systems.

## Race conditions

Race condition **is a type of vulnerability that occurs in computer systems when two or more processes or threads attempt to access and manipulate shared resources or data simultaneously, leading to unexpected or unpredictable behavior**. A race condition can arise when the outcome of a computation depends on the sequence or timing of events, and this sequence or timing can be altered by interference from other processes or threads. In the context of cybersecurity, race conditions can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to systems or data, execute malicious code, or cause denial of service (DoS) conditions.

### Time of check/time of use

The Time of Check/Time of Use (TOCTOU) **race condition is a type of security vulnerability that can occur when a program checks the state of a resource** (such as a file or network connection) **before using it, but the resource's state can change between the time it is checked and the time it is used**. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the resource's state to cause the program to perform unintended actions or grant unauthorized access.

The TOCTOU vulnerability can be especially problematic in situations where multiple processes or threads are accessing the same resource simultaneously. If one process or thread modifies the resource's state while another process or thread is checking its state, this can result in unexpected behavior and can potentially be exploited by attackers to execute malicious code.

To prevent TOCTOU vulnerabilities, programmers can use techniques such as file locking, atomic operations, and transactional memory to ensure that resources are accessed in a consistent and secure manner. Additionally, developers should be careful to validate user input and use appropriate error handling to prevent unexpected behavior.

## Error handling

Error handling **refers to the process of managing and responding to unexpected or erroneous events that occur during software execution**. In other words, it involves identifying and anticipating potential errors or exceptions, and implementing mechanisms to prevent or handle them when they occur. Proper error handling is essential for ensuring the stability, reliability, and security of software applications. Effective error handling includes a combination of techniques, such as exception handling, logging, testing, and debugging.

## Improper input handling

Improper input handling **is a vulnerability that occurs when an application does not properly validate or sanitize input data from users or other sources**. This can leave the application open to various types of attacks, including injection attacks, buffer overflows, and other forms of malicious code execution. Examples of improper input handling include not checking the length or format of user input, allowing input that includes special characters or code that can be executed by the application, and not validating input against expected values or ranges. Proper input handling is essential to ensure the security and reliability of software applications.

## Replay attack

A replay attack **is a type of cyber attack in which an attacker intercepts and records a legitimate data transmission and then resends it to its intended destination in order to impersonate the original sender**. This type of attack takes advantage of the fact that the recipient system will not be able to distinguish between the original transmission and the replayed transmission, and will therefore accept it as authentic. Replay attacks can be used to gain unauthorized access to systems or information, perform fraudulent transactions, or disrupt communication between systems. To prevent replay attacks, cryptographic techniques such as message authentication codes (MACs) or timestamps can be used to ensure the integrity and freshness of data transmissions.

### Session replays

Session replay attacks **are a type of replay attack in which an attacker records a user's session, including user inputs and server responses, and then replays the session to the server, impersonating the user**. The attacker can use various methods to record the session, such as capturing network traffic, using malware or keyloggers on the user's system, or even physically observing the user's activities.

The goal of session replay attacks is to gain unauthorized access to the user's account or to perform fraudulent activities on their behalf. For example, an attacker could use a session replay attack to bypass authentication mechanisms or to make unauthorized transactions on a user's behalf.

To prevent session replay attacks, applications should use strong authentication mechanisms, such as multi-factor authentication, and should encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest. Applications should also implement mechanisms to detect and prevent replay attacks, such as using session tokens that expire after a certain period of time or implementing mechanisms to detect and block replayed requests.

## Integer overflow

Integer overflow **is a type of computer programming error that can occur when an arithmetic operation attempts to create a numeric value that is outside the range that can be represented with a given number of bits**. This can lead to unexpected behavior, such as incorrect calculations or program crashes, and can also be exploited by attackers to execute malicious code or gain unauthorized access to a system. Integer overflow can occur in many types of programming languages, including C, C++, Java, and Python, and can be a difficult type of vulnerability to detect and mitigate.

## Request forgeries

### Server-side request forgery (SSRF)

Server-side request forgery (SSRF) **is a type of security vulnerability in which an attacker can manipulate the server into making an unintended request on behalf of the server or exploiting the trust of the server**. The attacker can send requests to other systems or services that are available to the server, such as internal resources or third-party systems, using the server's credentials and privileges. This can result in sensitive information disclosure, unauthorized access to resources, or a complete compromise of the system. SSRF attacks are often carried out through manipulated URLs, headers, or other input parameters that are sent to the server.

### Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) **is an attack technique that tricks a web application into performing an action that the user didn't intend or authorize**. The attacker sends a malicious request to the website, usually via a link or a form, that contains a hidden exploit code, which performs a specific action on the user's behalf without their knowledge or consent. The attack takes advantage of the fact that many web applications use session cookies to authenticate users and don't properly validate requests.

## Application programming interface (API) attacks

API attacks **refer to various types of attacks on the APIs used by web applications**. APIs are interfaces used by web applications to interact with external services, such as databases, other applications, and third-party services. API attacks aim to exploit vulnerabilities in these interfaces to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or take control of the application.

There are several types of API attacks, including:

1.  **Injection attacks**: these involve injecting malicious code or data into the API requests to exploit vulnerabilities in the application.
2.  **Parameter manipulation**: this involves manipulating the API parameters to bypass security controls and gain unauthorized access to resources.
3.  **Authentication attacks**: these involve exploiting vulnerabilities in the authentication process used by the API to gain unauthorized access to the application.
4.  **Denial-of-service attacks**: these involve overwhelming the API with a high volume of requests to disrupt its availability or performance.
5.  **Man-in-the-middle attacks**: these involve intercepting and manipulating API requests and responses to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data.    
6.  **API key attacks**: these involve stealing or guessing API keys to gain unauthorized access to the application.

It is important for developers to implement proper security controls and testing procedures to prevent API attacks and protect sensitive data.

## Resource exhaustion

Resource exhaustion **is a type of cyber attack in which an attacker attempts to overwhelm or deplete the resources of a targeted system or application**. The goal of this attack is to consume all available resources such as CPU, memory, disk space, or network bandwidth, so that the system becomes unresponsive or unusable. This type of attack is also known as a Denial of Service (DoS) attack, which can impact the availability of a service or application to legitimate users. Resource exhaustion attacks can be launched using various methods, such as sending a large volume of requests, exploiting vulnerabilities, or generating high traffic to a targeted system or network.

## Memory leak

A memory leak **is a type of software bug that occurs when a computer program fails to deallocate memory it has previously reserved, leading to a gradual loss of available memory**. This can cause the program to slow down or crash, and can ultimately affect the performance of the entire system. Memory leaks are a common problem in software development, particularly in languages like C and C++, which require manual memory management. In such languages, it is the programmer's responsibility to allocate and deallocate memory appropriately, which can be a complex task. If memory is not deallocated correctly, the program can run out of available memory, causing it to become unstable or crash.

## Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) stripping

SSL stripping **is a type of cyber attack where an attacker intercepts a secure connection between a client and a server and downgrades it to an insecure HTTP connection**. The attacker can then monitor and manipulate the data being sent between the client and server. This type of attack is particularly effective when a user is trying to connect to a secure website, such as a banking or e-commerce site, and is unaware that their connection has been compromised. SSL stripping can be prevented by using HTTPS connections, which encrypt all data sent between the client and server, and by ensuring that the user is always on an encrypted connection.

## Driver manipulation

Driver manipulation **is a technique used by attackers to compromise a system's security by manipulating a device driver, which is a software component that controls a particular hardware device**. An attacker can modify the driver's behavior by injecting malicious code or modifying the driver's code, allowing them to take control of the device or gain elevated privileges on the system. This technique can be used to bypass security measures or gain access to sensitive information on a system. Attackers can also use driver manipulation to hide their presence on a system, making it more difficult to detect and remove them.

Shimming and refactoring are two techniques that can be used to modify a driver's behavior.

### Shimming

Shimming **is a technique that involves adding an additional layer of code between the operating system and the driver**. This additional layer can be used to intercept calls to the driver and modify their behavior. Shimming can be used to fix bugs in a driver or to add new functionality.

### Refactoring

Refactoring, on the other hand, **involves modifying the source code of the driver itself**. This can be a more invasive technique than shimming, as it requires a deeper understanding of the driver's code. Refactoring can be used to optimize the performance of a driver or to add new features.

Both shimming and refactoring can be used for legitimate purposes, such as fixing bugs or adding new functionality. However, they can also be used for malicious purposes, such as bypassing security checks or stealing data. Therefore, it is important to ensure that drivers are only modified by authorized parties and that modifications are thoroughly tested before being deployed.

## Pass the hash

Pass the hash (PtH) **is a type of cyber attack that involves stealing hashed credentials from a computer or server and then using these hashes to authenticate as the user or administrator, without the need for their actual password**.

The attacker first gains access to the target system and extracts the hashed password from the system's memory or from a file on disk. Then, the attacker can use this hash to authenticate as the user or administrator to other systems or services that trust the same hash, essentially bypassing the need for the actual password. This technique is especially effective against systems that use the NTLM authentication protocol.

PtH attacks are difficult to detect, as they do not involve stealing the actual password and may not trigger authentication failure notifications. The best defense against PtH attacks is to implement strong password policies, limit the number of systems that trust the same hash, and use multi-factor authentication whenever possible.
