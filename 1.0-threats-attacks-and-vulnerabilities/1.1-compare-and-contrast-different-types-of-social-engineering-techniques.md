# 1.1 Compare and contrast different types of social engineering techniques

## Phishing

A phishing attack **is a type of social engineering attack in which an attacker sends a fraudulent email or message**, typically with a malicious link or attachment, to trick the recipient into revealing sensitive information, such as login credentials, financial information, or personal data.

The email or message may appear to come from a trusted source, such as a bank, social media site, or a familiar brand. The attacker's goal is to deceive the recipient into clicking on the link or opening the attachment, which may download malware onto their computer or direct them to a fake website designed to steal their login credentials or other sensitive information.

Phishing attacks are a common tactic used by cybercriminals to steal sensitive information and gain unauthorized access to networks, systems, and data. To avoid falling victim to phishing attacks, it is important to be cautious when opening emails or messages, to verify the sender's identity before clicking on links or opening attachments, and to use two-factor authentication whenever possible.

## Smishing

Smishing **is a type of phishing attack that uses SMS** (Short Message Service) or text messages to deceive victims into divulging sensitive information, installing malware on their device, or visiting a malicious website. The term "*smishing*" is a combination of "*SMS*" and "*phishing*."

Smishing attacks can be difficult to detect because text messages are often considered more trustworthy than emails, and victims may be more likely to take action immediately without questioning the validity of the message. To protect against smishing attacks, users should be cautious when clicking on links or responding to text messages from unknown or suspicious sources, and avoid sharing personal or financial information over text messages. It is also advisable to keep software and mobile apps up-to-date, and to use security software on your device.

## Vishing

Vishing **is a type of phishing attack that uses voice or telephone communications** to deceive victims into divulging sensitive information, such as passwords, account numbers, or credit card information. The term "*vishing*" is a combination of "*voice*" and "*phishing*."

During the call, the attacker will try to gain the victim's trust by using a friendly tone, creating a sense of urgency, or posing as a security or fraud prevention officer. The attacker may ask the victim to confirm their personal or financial information, such as their Social Security number, account number, or password, under the guise of a security check or investigation.

To protect against vishing attacks, it is important to be cautious when receiving unexpected phone calls or voice messages, especially from unknown or suspicious sources. Do not provide sensitive information over the phone unless you are absolutely sure of the caller's identity. If you are unsure, hang up and call the organization directly using a trusted phone number to verify the legitimacy of the request. It is also important to be aware that attackers may use a combination of vishing and other social engineering techniques, such as phishing or smishing, to increase their chances of success.

## Spam

Spam **refers to unsolicited or unwanted messages** that are sent in bulk via email, messaging apps, social media platforms, or other communication channels. These messages often contain advertisements, scams, phishing attacks, or malware, and are typically sent to a large number of recipients who have not expressed any interest in receiving them. In addition to email, spam can also come in the form of text messages, phone calls, and social media messages.

To prevent spam, users can take steps such as using spam filters, blocking messages from unknown or suspicious senders, and being cautious about sharing their email address or other contact information online.

## Spam over instant messaging (SPIM)

Spam over Instant Messaging (SPIM) **is a type of unsolicited or unwanted messages that are sent in bulk via instant messaging (IM) platforms**, such as WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, or Skype. Similar to email spam, SPIM messages are typically commercial advertisements, phishing attacks, scams, or malware, and are sent to a large number of users who have not requested them. In addition, SPIM messages can disrupt communication and productivity, especially in a work environment.

To prevent SPIM, users can take steps such as configuring privacy settings on their IM accounts, blocking messages from unknown or suspicious senders, and being cautious about sharing their IM contact information online. Some IM platforms also offer built-in spam filters or reporting tools to help users identify and block SPIM messages.

## Spear phishing

Spear phishing **is a type of targeted phishing** attack that involves sending personalized and highly-customized emails, text messages, or social media messages to specific individuals or organizations. The aim of spear phishing is to trick the target into divulging sensitive information or performing an action that benefits the attacker, such as clicking on a link, downloading malware, or transferring money.

Unlike traditional phishing attacks that typically use generic messages sent to a large number of recipients, spear phishing attacks are highly customized and often appear to come from a trusted source, such as a colleague, manager, or business partner. The attackers may use publicly available information, such as social media profiles or corporate websites, to gather information about the target's job responsibilities, interests, and relationships, in order to craft a convincing message that appears legitimate. For these reasons, spear phishing attacks can be highly effective because they are tailored to the target's specific context and use social engineering techniques to create a sense of urgency or authority.

To protect against spear phishing attacks, it is important to be cautious when receiving unexpected or suspicious messages, especially if they request sensitive information or prompt you to take immediate action. Users should also be aware of the potential risks of sharing personal or professional information online, and should use strong passwords and two-factor authentication to protect their accounts. Additionally, it is important to stay up-to-date with the latest security best practices and to regularly review and update security policies and procedures.

## Dumpster diving

Dumpster diving is a type of physical security attack that **involves searching through trash or discarded materials** to find sensitive or confidential information that can be used to compromise a person, organization, or system. This can include documents, files, or electronic devices that contain personal or financial information, login credentials, or other sensitive data.

Dumpster diving can be a low-tech but effective way for attackers to obtain information that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to access through digital means. For example, attackers may search through the trash of a business to find discarded customer records or financial statements, or they may search through the trash of an individual to find credit card statements or other personal information.

To prevent dumpster diving attacks, it is important to properly dispose of sensitive information and materials by shredding documents or destroying electronic devices before disposing of them. In addition, businesses should establish clear policies and procedures for the disposal of confidential information and provide training to employees on how to follow these procedures. It is also important to be aware of the potential risks of sharing personal or professional information online, and to use strong passwords and two-factor authentication to protect online accounts.

## Shoulder surfing

Shoulder surfing is a type of physical security attack that **involves an attacker observing or eavesdropping on a person as they enter sensitive or confidential information**, such as passwords or PIN numbers, into a device or system. This can be done by looking over the person's shoulder or using binoculars or other tools to view the screen from a distance.

Shoulder surfing can be a low-tech but effective way for attackers to obtain information that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to access through digital means. For example, an attacker may watch a person enter their PIN number at an ATM or observe their login credentials as they type them into a computer in a public space.

To prevent shoulder surfing attacks, it is important to be aware of your surroundings and to take steps to protect your sensitive information. This can include positioning yourself in a way that makes it difficult for others to see your screen, using privacy screens or filters on your devices, or using your body to shield your screen from view. It is also important to use strong passwords and two-factor authentication to protect your online accounts, and to avoid sharing sensitive information in public spaces.

## Pharming

Pharming **is a type of cyber attack that involves redirecting a user's web traffic to a fake website that is designed to look like a legitimate one**. The aim of pharming is to trick the user into divulging sensitive information, such as login credentials, credit card numbers, or other personal information, which can then be used for fraudulent purposes.

Pharming attacks can be conducted using a variety of methods, including manipulating domain name system (DNS) settings, exploiting vulnerabilities in web browsers or network devices, or infecting a user's computer with malware that redirects web traffic to a fake site. In some cases, attackers may also use social engineering techniques to trick users into visiting a fake site, such as by sending phishing emails that contain links to a fake website.

To protect against pharming attacks, it is important to use trusted sources for web browsing and to be cautious when visiting unfamiliar or suspicious websites. Users should also keep their web browsers and other software up-to-date with the latest security patches and should use anti-virus software and firewalls to protect their devices. In addition, it is important to be cautious when clicking on links or downloading attachments from unknown or suspicious sources, and to be wary of any unexpected or unsolicited messages that request sensitive information.

## Tailgating

Tailgating **is a physical security attack that involves an unauthorized person following closely behind an authorized person** to gain access to a restricted area or secure facility. This can occur when the authorized person uses a key card, access code, or other means to enter the restricted area, and the unauthorized person quickly follows behind them before the door or gate closes.

Tailgating can be a low-tech but effective way for attackers to gain access to sensitive areas or systems that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to access through digital means. For example, an attacker may tailgate an employee into a secure data center or server room in order to steal or manipulate sensitive data.

To prevent tailgating attacks, it is important to establish clear policies and procedures for access control and to provide training to employees on how to follow these procedures. This can include requiring employees to use their own key cards or access codes to enter secure areas, and to be aware of their surroundings and to report any suspicious behavior. In addition, physical security measures such as security cameras, turnstiles, or security guards can be used to monitor access to restricted areas and deter unauthorized access.

## Eliciting information

Eliciting information **is a type of social engineering attack that involves an attacker using various techniques to gather sensitive or confidential information from a victim**. The aim of this attack is to gain access to information that can be used for fraudulent purposes, such as stealing identities, committing financial fraud, or compromising computer systems.

Eliciting information can take many forms, including posing as a trusted authority figure, such as a bank or government official, and requesting sensitive information over the phone or email, or using pretexting techniques to trick the victim into divulging information, such as by pretending to be a friend or family member. Other techniques may include using flattery or sympathy to gain the victim's trust, or providing false information to convince the victim to disclose information.

To prevent eliciting information attacks, it is important to be cautious when sharing sensitive information and to be aware of common tactics used by attackers. This can include verifying the identity of anyone requesting sensitive information, using secure communication channels such as encrypted email or secure messaging apps, and being skeptical of unsolicited requests for information.

## Whaling

Whaling **is a type of phishing attack that targets high-profile individuals**, such as executives or high-level employees, in order to steal sensitive information or gain access to valuable resources. The term "*whaling*" is used because these attacks typically focus on "*big fish*" targets, rather than casting a wide net like traditional phishing attacks.

Whaling attacks can take many forms, but typically involve the use of social engineering techniques to trick the victim into divulging sensitive information, such as login credentials or financial information. For example, an attacker may send a convincing email that appears to be from a trusted authority, such as a bank or government agency, and request that the victim provide sensitive information or click on a link that installs malware on their computer.

To prevent whaling attacks, it is important for high-profile individuals to be aware of the risks and to take steps to protect their personal and professional information. This can include using strong passwords and two-factor authentication to protect online accounts, being cautious when clicking on links or downloading attachments from unknown sources, and verifying the identity of anyone requesting sensitive information. In addition, regular security awareness training can help employees recognize and respond to potential whaling attacks.

## Prepending

Prepending **is a technique used by attackers to manipulate file names or website addresses in order to deceive users or bypass security measures**. In prepending, an attacker adds a string of characters to the beginning of a file name or URL in order to disguise its true nature or to evade detection by security software.

Some examples are, an attacker may prepend a file name with a string of characters that causes it to appear innocuous or as a different type of file, or an attacker can create fake websites that appear to be legitimate and add a string of characters to the beginning of a URL that makes it appear to be a trusted site.

To prevent prepending attacks, it is important to be cautious when opening files or visiting websites, particularly if they appear suspicious or have unusual file names or URLs. Users should also keep their software and security measures up-to-date and use trusted sources for downloading files and accessing websites. In addition, regular security awareness training can help users recognize and respond to potential attacks.

## Identity fraud

Identity fraud, also known as identity theft, **is a type of fraud in which an attacker steals the personal information of a victim in order to impersonate them** and gain access to their financial or other sensitive information. The attacker may use the stolen identity to open new accounts, make purchases, or commit other fraudulent activities in the victim's name.

Identity fraud can occur through various means, including stealing physical documents such as passports or credit cards, accessing computer systems or databases that contain sensitive information, or using social engineering techniques such as phishing or pretexting to obtain sensitive information.

To protect against identity fraud, individuals should take steps to safeguard their personal information, such as using strong and unique passwords for online accounts, monitoring financial statements and credit reports regularly, and being cautious when providing personal information online or over the phone. In addition, organizations should have robust security measures in place to protect customer and employee data, such as encryption, access controls, and regular security assessments.

## Invoice scams

Invoice scams **are a type of fraud in which an attacker attempts to trick a business or individual into paying a fake or fraudulent invoice**. These scams often involve the attacker posing as a legitimate vendor or supplier and sending a fraudulent invoice for goods or services that were never provided or authorized.

To protect against invoice scams, businesses and individuals should be cautious when receiving invoices, particularly if they appear suspicious or unexpected. It is important to verify the identity of the sender and the authenticity of the invoice, for example, by cross-checking it with purchase orders or other documentation. Employees should also be trained to recognize and respond to potential invoice scams, and organizations should have robust policies and procedures in place for verifying and approving invoices before payment is made.

## Credential harvesting

Credential harvesting **is a technique used by attackers to obtain login credentials**, such as usernames and passwords, from unsuspecting users. This is typically done through phishing emails or fake login pages designed to mimic legitimate websites or services. Its goal is to gain access to sensitive information or systems, which can then be used for fraudulent purposes such as unauthorized purchases, identity theft, or further attacks on other systems or users.

To protect against credential harvesting, users should be wary of entering their login credentials on websites that look different than what they normally use or require additional information that is not normally requested. Organizations can also implement security measures such as two-factor authentication, intrusion detection systems, and security awareness training for employees to mitigate the risk of credential harvesting attacks.

## Reconnaissance

Reconnaissance, often referred to as recon, **is the process of gathering information about a target or target environment**. In the context of information security, reconnaissance is often used by attackers to gather information about a target system or network in order to identify vulnerabilities or potential attack vectors.

**Reconnaissance can take various forms, including passive and active techniques**. Passive reconnaissance involves gathering information without directly interacting with the target, such as through public information sources like social media, online forums, or search engines. Active reconnaissance, on the other hand, involves directly interacting with the target, such as by scanning the target network for open ports or running vulnerability scans.

The information gathered through reconnaissance can be used to identify potential weaknesses or vulnerabilities that could be exploited in an attack. For example, an attacker may use reconnaissance to identify outdated software or systems with known vulnerabilities that can be exploited.

To protect against reconnaissance attacks, organizations can implement security measures such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and network monitoring tools to detect and block malicious activity. Organizations can also reduce their attack surface by minimizing the amount of sensitive information that is publicly available and implementing security awareness training for employees to help identify and report suspicious activity.

## Hoax

A hoax **is a type of deception or prank that is intended to trick or mislead people**. In the context of information security, a hoax can take various forms, such as fake warnings or alerts, false rumors, or fake news stories.

Hoaxes can be spread through various channels, such as social media, email, or messaging apps, and can be used to cause panic or confusion among the targeted audience. They can also be used as a social engineering tactic to gain access to sensitive information or systems.

To protect against hoaxes, individuals and organizations should be cautious when receiving and sharing information, particularly if it appears suspicious or unexpected. It is important to verify the source and authenticity of any information before taking action, and to be skeptical of claims that seem too good to be true or that generate an emotional response. In addition, organizations should implement security awareness training for employees to help them recognize and respond to hoaxes and other social engineering tactics.

## Impersonation

Impersonation **is the act of pretending to be someone else** in order to deceive others or gain access to sensitive information or systems. In the context of information security, impersonation is often used as a social engineering tactic to trick users into divulging sensitive information or granting access to restricted systems.

Impersonation can take various forms, such as pretending to be a trusted authority figure, such as a bank representative or IT administrator, or impersonating a coworker or other employee. Impersonation can also be carried out through various channels, such as email, phone, or in-person interactions.

To protect against impersonation attacks, individuals and organizations should be cautious when receiving and responding to requests for sensitive information or access to restricted systems. It is important to verify the identity and legitimacy of the requester through known, trusted channels, such as by contacting the person directly or checking with a supervisor or IT administrator.

## Watering hole attack

A watering hole attack **is a type of cyber attack in which an attacker targets a specific group of users by infecting websites that the targeted group is known to visit**, in the hopes of infecting the users with malware or obtaining sensitive information.

The term "*watering hole*" refers to the tactic of lying in wait for prey at a location where the prey is known to congregate, such as a watering hole in the wild. In the context of cybersecurity, a watering hole attack involves an attacker identifying a group of users with a common interest, such as employees of a particular company or members of a particular industry group, and infecting websites that the group is known to frequent.

The attacker may compromise the website by injecting malicious code, redirecting users to a malicious site, or infecting ads or plugins on the site. When users visit the infected site, their devices may be infected with malware, which can then be used to steal sensitive information or carry out other types of attacks.

Watering hole attacks can be difficult to detect and defend against, as they rely on infecting legitimate websites that the targeted users are likely to visit. To protect against watering hole attacks, organizations should implement security measures such as intrusion detection systems, web filters, and endpoint protection software to detect and block malicious activity. It is also important for users to keep their devices and software up-to-date, and to be cautious when visiting unfamiliar websites or downloading unknown files.

## Typosquatting

Typosquatting, also known as URL hijacking or domain mimicry, **is a type of cybersquatting where an attacker registers a domain name that is similar to a legitimate website's domain name, but with typographical errors or slight variations**. The attacker may use the domain to deceive users who mistype the legitimate website's URL or to redirect them to a malicious site.

Typosquatting can be difficult to detect, as the typosquatted domain may appear legitimate at first glance. However, users can protect themselves by being cautious when entering website addresses and double-checking the URL before entering sensitive information. Organizations can also protect their users by registering similar domain names and redirecting them to the legitimate site, as well as monitoring for typosquatted domains and taking legal action against attackers who engage in typosquatting.

## Pretexting

Pretexting **is a form of social engineering in which an attacker creates a false scenario or pretext to trick someone into divulging sensitive information or performing an action that they normally would not do**. The attacker may impersonate someone else, such as a coworker or a customer service representative, and use the false identity to gain the victim's trust.

Pretexting relies on manipulating the victim's trust and exploiting their desire to be helpful. To protect against pretexting, it is important to be cautious when receiving unexpected requests for information or action, and to verify the identity of the person making the request through a separate channel, such as a known phone number or email address. It is also important to avoid divulging sensitive information or performing actions based solely on a request, without proper verification and validation.

## Influence campaigns

Influence campaigns **refer to coordinated efforts by individuals or organizations to shape public opinion or influence political outcomes**. Influence campaigns can take many forms, including disinformation, propaganda, and manipulation of social media or online forums.

Influence campaigns can be difficult to detect and combat, as they often involve sophisticated techniques and use multiple channels to reach their targets. To protect against influence campaigns, individuals should be critical of the information they receive, fact-check sources before sharing or acting on information, and be aware of the potential biases and motivations of those who are promoting a particular message. Organizations can also take steps to educate employees and stakeholders about the risks of influence campaigns and implement policies and procedures to mitigate the impact of these campaigns.

### Hybrid warfare

Hybrid warfare **is a type of warfare that involves the use of a combination of conventional and unconventional tactics**, including influence campaigns, **to achieve military or strategic objectives**. In the context of influence campaigns, hybrid warfare refers to the use of influence operations to shape public opinion and undermine the legitimacy of opponents in a military or geopolitical conflict.

For example, in a hybrid warfare scenario, an adversary may use influence campaigns to sow confusion and discord among the population of an adversary country, weaken support for the government, and promote a particular agenda or ideology. This can be done through a variety of tactics, such as spreading false information, creating fake news stories or websites, and manipulating social media or other online forums.

Hybrid warfare is often used by state actors, but can also be employed by non-state actors or even individuals. It can be difficult to combat, as it involves a combination of conventional and unconventional tactics, and can be carried out across multiple domains, including cyberspace, social media, and traditional media.

To protect against hybrid warfare, governments and organizations should be vigilant for signs of influence campaigns and take steps to detect and counter these operations. This may involve monitoring social media and other online platforms for signs of disinformation and propaganda, conducting media literacy campaigns to educate the public on how to identify false information, and building resilience and resistance to influence campaigns through strong democratic institutions and civil society.

### Social Media

Social media **is a powerful tool for influence campaigns**, as it allows individuals and organizations to reach a large audience quickly and easily. In the context of influence campaigns, social media can be used to spread propaganda, disinformation, and other forms of manipulative content with the aim of shaping public opinion and influencing political outcomes.

Social media platforms can be targeted for influence campaigns for a variety of reasons, such as to promote a particular ideology or agenda, to discredit opponents, or to sow confusion and chaos. Influence campaigns on social media can take many forms, such as the creation of fake accounts and bot networks to amplify certain messages, the use of paid advertising to target specific audiences, and the spread of false or misleading information through posts and articles.

The impact of social media on influence campaigns is significant, as it allows for the rapid dissemination of information and the amplification of certain messages. However, social media can also be used to combat influence campaigns, through the use of fact-checking, user education, and the promotion of critical thinking skills. Social media platforms themselves can also take steps to combat influence campaigns, such as by implementing policies to detect and remove fake accounts and bot networks, and by partnering with fact-checking organizations to identify and label false information.

### Principles (reasons for effectiveness)

Social engineering refers to the use of psychological manipulation techniques to influence individuals or groups to divulge sensitive information or perform actions that may not be in their best interest. There are several principles that underlie social engineering tactics:

1.  **Authority**: Social engineers often present themselves as figures of authority, such as a law enforcement officer, IT technician, or supervisor, in order to gain trust and convince the target to comply with their requests.
2. **Intimidation**: Social engineers may use intimidation tactics by making threats of physical harm, legal consequences, or damage to the target's reputation or financial status. The goal of intimidation is to create a sense of fear or vulnerability in the target, in order to coerce them into complying with the social engineer's requests or divulging sensitive information.
3. **Consencus**: Social engineers may use consensus tactics by presenting themselves as part of a larger group or authority, and implying that others have already complied with their requests. This can create a sense of pressure or social expectation for the target to comply as well, as they may feel that others are expecting them to do so.
4.  **Scarcity**: Social engineers may create a sense of urgency or scarcity in order to pressure the target into taking action, such as by claiming that there are limited resources or time to act.
5.  **Familiarity**: Social engineers may use information about the target's personal or professional life in order to establish a rapport and build trust, such as by using the target's name or referencing shared interests.
6. **Trust**: Social engineers may use trust tactics by building a rapport with the target and appearing to be trustworthy or authoritative, in order to gain access to sensitive information or to influence the target's behavior. This can be done through impersonating trusted individuals or organizations, using official-looking documents or uniforms, or using convincing language and social cues.
7. **Urgency**: Social engineers may use urgency tactics by creating a sense of urgency or time pressure in order to influence the target's behavior. This can be done through creating a false sense of urgency, such as by claiming that there is an imminent threat or emergency that requires immediate action, or by setting strict deadlines or time limits for the target to comply.
8.  **Reciprocity**: Social engineers may offer something of value to the target in order to gain compliance, such as by offering a reward or making a concession.
9. **Likability**: Social engineers may use charm or flattery to build rapport and trust with the target, in order to increase the likelihood of compliance.

These principles can be used in a variety of ways, depending on the specific social engineering tactic being employed. By understanding these principles, individuals and organizations can better protect themselves against social engineering attacks.
