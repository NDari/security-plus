# 5.4 Summarize risk management processes and concepts

## Risk types

Risk types **refer to the various categories or classifications of potential risks that organizations face**. Each type of risk presents unique challenges and requires specific strategies and controls to mitigate.

The following are some examples of risk types:

1. **External risks**: These are risks that originate outside of the organization, such as natural disasters, cyber attacks, or economic downturns.
2. **Internal risks**: These are risks that arise from within the organization, such as employee theft, fraud, or mismanagement.
3. **Legacy systems risks**: These are risks that arise from the use of outdated technology or systems, which can be vulnerable to security threats or may fail to meet compliance requirements.
4. **Multiparty risks**: These are risks that arise from interactions with third-party vendors, partners, or other entities, such as supply chain disruptions or vendor breaches.
5. **IP theft risks**: These are risks that arise from the theft or unauthorized use of intellectual property, such as trade secrets or patents.
6. **Software compliance/licensing risks**: These are risks that arise from noncompliance with software licensing agreements, which can result in legal penalties or financial losses.

Each of these risk types requires specific controls and strategies to manage and mitigate their potential impact on the organization.

## Risk management strategies

Risk management strategies **are the methods used by organizations to identify, evaluate, and prioritize risks and then implement controls or other measures to mitigate or manage those risks**. The following are the commonly used risk management strategies:

1. **Risk acceptance**: This strategy involves accepting the potential consequences of a risk and making a decision to do nothing about it. This can be appropriate when the cost of addressing the risk is higher than the potential impact of the risk.
2. **Risk avoidance**: This strategy involves avoiding or eliminating the risk altogether. For example, an organization might decide not to pursue a particular business opportunity if it involves a risk that is considered too high.
3. **Risk transference**: This strategy involves transferring the risk to another party. This can be done through various means, including purchasing insurance, outsourcing the risk to a third-party vendor, or entering into a contract with another party that specifies the allocation of risk.
4. **Risk mitigation**: This strategy involves implementing controls or other measures to reduce the likelihood or impact of a risk. This can include implementing technical controls, developing policies and procedures, or providing employee training.

## Risk analysis

Risk analysis **is the process of identifying, assessing, and evaluating potential risks to an organization's assets, systems, operations, and objectives**. It is an important aspect of information security management that helps organizations identify vulnerabilities and develop strategies to mitigate risk. The following are some key terms related to risk analysis:

- **Risk register**: A document that lists all identified risks, including their likelihood, impact, and associated risk mitigation strategies.
- **Risk matrix/heat map**: A visual representation of the likelihood and impact of various risks, used to prioritize risks for mitigation.
- **Risk control assessment**: An evaluation of the effectiveness of existing risk controls and their ability to reduce or eliminate risk.
- **Risk control self-assessment**: A self-assessment process used by individuals or teams to identify and assess risks within their areas of responsibility.
- **Risk awareness**: The level of awareness and understanding of risks within an organization, including the potential consequences of a risk event.
- **Inherent risk**: The level of risk before any controls or mitigation strategies are implemented.
- **Residual risk**: The level of risk remaining after controls or mitigation strategies have been implemented.
- **Control risk**: The risk that a control will fail or not operate as intended.
- **Risk appetite**: The level of risk that an organization is willing to accept in pursuit of its objectives.
- **Regulations that affect risk posture**: Laws, regulations, or industry standards that impact an organization's risk posture or risk management strategies.
- **Risk assessments**: Two types of risk assessment methods used to evaluate risks. Qualitative risk assessments involve subjective judgments and opinions, while quantitative risk assessments involve the use of mathematical calculations and objective data to determine risk levels.
- **Likelihood of occurrence**: The probability or chance that a risk event will occur.
- **Impact**: The effect or consequence of a risk event on an organization's assets, systems, operations, or objectives.
- **Asset value**: The estimated value of an organization's assets, including physical assets, intellectual property, and data.
- **Single-loss expectancy (SLE)**: The estimated monetary loss associated with a single occurrence of a risk event.
- **Annualized loss expectancy (ALE)**: The estimated annual monetary loss associated with a risk event, calculated by multiplying the SLE by the annualized rate of occurrence.
- **Annualized rate of occurrence (ARO)**: The estimated number of times a risk event will occur in a given year.

## Disasters

Disasters **are events or incidents that can have significant and negative impacts on individuals, organizations, and society**. Disasters can be caused by a wide range of factors, including natural phenomena, human error, or malicious activities.

Some common types of disasters include environmental, person-made, internal and external.

**Environmental disasters are caused by natural events** such as earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, or wildfires. These disasters can have a significant impact on infrastructure, supply chains, and the economy, as well as on human life and the environment.

**Person-made disasters**, on the other hand, **are caused by human activities** such as accidents, negligence, or intentional actions. These disasters can include things like industrial accidents, transportation accidents, and cyberattacks.

**Internal disasters are those that occur within an organization**, such as data breaches, insider threats, or system failures. **External disasters**, on the other hand, **are events that occur outside of an organization but can still have a significant impact on it**, such as natural disasters or terrorist attacks.

It is important for organizations to have disaster recovery and business continuity plans in place to minimize the impact of disasters and ensure that critical business functions can continue in the event of an unexpected disruption.

## Business impact analysis

Business impact analysis (BIA) **is a process used to identify and evaluate the potential effects of disruptions to business operations**. The BIA assesses the impact of disruptions on critical business functions, systems, and processes, and identifies the recovery time objectives (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO) necessary to resume normal business operations.

Here are some key terms related to BIA:

- **Recovery time objective (RTO)**: the maximum amount of time allowed for the restoration of critical business processes after a disruption.
- **Recovery point objective (RPO)**: the maximum amount of data loss that can be tolerated in the event of a disruption.
- **Mean time to repair (MTTR)**: the average time it takes to repair a failed system or component.
- **Mean time between failures (MTBF)**: the average time between failures of a system or component.
- **Functional recovery plans**: plans for restoring critical business processes and systems in the event of a disruption.
- **Single point of failure**: a component or system that, if it fails, would cause a critical business process to fail.
- **Disaster recovery plan (DRP)**: a plan for recovering critical systems and data in the event of a disaster.
- **Mission essential functions**: the critical functions and processes that an organization must perform to achieve its mission.
- **Identification of critical systems**: the identification of the systems and processes that are critical to an organization's operations.
- **Site risk assessment**: an assessment of the potential risks that could affect an organization's facilities, including natural disasters, man-made disasters, and other hazards.
