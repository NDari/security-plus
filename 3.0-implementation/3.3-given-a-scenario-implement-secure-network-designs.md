File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) is a security solution designed to detect and alert on any unauthorized or unexpected changes to critical files and directories on a system or network. FIM compares the current state of files and directories to their baseline or previous state, detecting any changes such as modifications, deletions, or additions. FIM can help organizations detect and prevent unauthorized access, data exfiltration, and data breaches.

FIM typically operates by creating a snapshot of the baseline of the files and directories to be monitored. This baseline is used as a reference point for future changes, with any deviations from the baseline flagged as potentially suspicious. FIM can also generate alerts and notifications to administrators when a change is detected, and in some cases, can even block unauthorized changes or roll back unauthorized changes to the previous state.

FIM can be deployed on individual systems or across an entire network, and can be configured to monitor a variety of files, including configuration files, system files, and user-generated files. FIM can also be integrated with other security solutions, such as Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems and Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS) to provide a more comprehensive security posture.
