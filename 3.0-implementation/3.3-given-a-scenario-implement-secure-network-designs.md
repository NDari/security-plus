## Load balancing

Load balancing **is the process of distributing incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure that no single server is overloaded, and to improve performance, reliability, and availability**. Load balancing can be implemented using hardware or software-based solutions.

Some of the key concepts associated with load balancing include:

- **Active/active**: This is a load balancing configuration in which all servers in the pool are actively handling requests at the same time. This type of configuration is typically used in environments where high availability is critical.
- **Active/passive**: This is a load balancing configuration in which one server in the pool is active and the others are passive, standing by as backups in case the active server fails. This type of configuration is typically used in environments where cost is a concern and high availability is not as critical.
- **Scheduling**: This refers to the algorithm used by the load balancer to determine which server in the pool should handle each incoming request. Some common scheduling algorithms include round robin, least connections, and IP hash.
- **Virtual IP**: This is an IP address that is used by the load balancer to represent a pool of servers. When a client connects to the virtual IP, the load balancer routes the request to one of the servers in the pool.
- **Persistence**: This refers to the ability of the load balancer to maintain state between the client and the server. Persistence can be implemented using source IP address, cookies, or other techniques to ensure that subsequent requests from the same client are directed to the same server.

## Network segmentation

Network segmentation **is a security strategy that involves dividing a computer network into smaller subnetworks to reduce the impact of a security breach**. The main idea behind network segmentation is to limit the exposure of sensitive information by controlling access to it. Here are some common types of network segmentation:

1. **Virtual local area network (VLAN)**: VLAN is a type of network segmentation that enables you to group devices together based on their functions or logical groupings. This helps to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data by separating them from other devices.
2. **Screened subnet (previously known as demilitarized zone)**: A screened subnet is a network that is located between an organization's internal network and the public Internet. The screened subnet provides an additional layer of security by filtering traffic between the internal network and the Internet.
3. **East-west traffic**: East-west traffic refers to the traffic that flows between servers or workloads within a data center. East-west traffic is usually less protected than north-south traffic (traffic that flows between the Internet and the internal network), making it an attractive target for attackers.
4. **Extranet**: An extranet is a private network that connects two or more organizations over the Internet. Extranets are often used to share data and resources securely between organizations.
5  **Intranet**: An intranet is a private network that is used within an organization. Intranets are often used to share information and resources between departments or teams within an organization.
5. **Zero Trust**: Zero Trust is a security concept that assumes that every device or user that tries to access a network is potentially compromised. Zero Trust networks verify every device or user that tries to access the network, and they limit access to only the resources that are needed to perform specific tasks.

## Virtual private network (VPN)

A Virtual Private Network (VPN) **is a secure, encrypted connection that allows users to access a private network over a public network such as the Internet**. VPNs are commonly used to provide remote access for users, secure communication between geographically separated offices, and to protect sensitive data while in transit.

Here are some on VPN-related terms:

- **Always-on**: Refers to a VPN connection that is automatically established and maintained whenever a device connects to the Internet. This ensures that all traffic from the device is encrypted and routed through the VPN tunnel.
- **Split tunnel vs. full tunnel**: In a split tunnel VPN, only traffic intended for the remote network is routed through the VPN tunnel, while other traffic is sent directly to the Internet. In a full tunnel VPN, all traffic is routed through the VPN tunnel, regardless of its destination.
- **Remote access vs. site-to-site**: Remote access VPNs are used by individual users to securely connect to a private network from a remote location, while site-to-site VPNs are used to securely connect multiple networks together over the Internet.
- **IPSec**: Internet Protocol Security (IPSec) is a suite of protocols used to encrypt and authenticate IP packets. It is commonly used in VPNs to establish a secure tunnel between devices.
- **SSL/TLS**: Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and its successor, Transport Layer Security (TLS), are cryptographic protocols used to secure web traffic. They are commonly used in SSL/TLS VPNs to establish a secure connection between a user's device and a web server.
- **HTML5**: HTML5 VPNs use web technologies such as JavaScript and HTML5 to establish a secure connection between a user's device and a web server, eliminating the need for client-side software.
- **Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP)**: L2TP is a protocol used to tunnel data over an IP network. It is commonly used in combination with IPSec to provide a secure VPN connection.

## DNS

DNS **stands for Domain Name System, which is a hierarchical and decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the internet or a private network**. It translates domain names, which are easy-to-remember words and phrases, into IP addresses, which are numerical addresses that computers use to identify each other on the network. This allows users to access websites, send emails, and perform other network activities using human-readable domain names instead of having to remember and enter lengthy IP addresses. The DNS system is composed of several components, including DNS servers, DNS resolvers, and DNS zones, which work together to manage the domain name resolution process.

## Network access control (NAC)

Network Access Control (NAC) **is a security solution that is designed to control access to network resources based on the user's identity, device type, and compliance with security policies**. NAC solutions can be implemented through agents or agentless methods.

**Agent-based NAC solutions require the installation of software agents on the endpoints**, which are responsible for providing information about the device's security status and compliance with security policies. The agents can also enforce security policies on the endpoint, such as disabling access to the network if the endpoint is found to be non-compliant.

**On the other hand, agentless NAC solutions use network-based techniques to assess the security status of endpoints and enforce security policies**. These techniques may include network scanning, vulnerability assessments, and identity-based authentication. Unlike agent-based solutions, agentless NAC does not require software installation on the endpoints, which can simplify deployment and management. However, agentless solutions may not provide the same level of granular control over endpoints as agent-based solutions.

## Out-of-band management

Out-of-band management **refers to the management of networking devices or systems through a separate, dedicated management channel that is physically separated from the primary data path or "*in-band*" network**. This is done to provide secure and reliable access to manage the devices or systems without being affected by any issues that may arise on the primary network.

In an out-of-band management setup, a separate management network is created that is only accessible through dedicated management interfaces on the devices being managed. This allows network administrators to remotely manage the devices, even if the primary network is down or experiencing issues. Out-of-band management can include tasks such as configuration, troubleshooting, monitoring, and firmware upgrades.

## Port security

Port security **is a feature of network switches that enables administrators to specify which devices are allowed to connect to a specific switch port**. This is typically done to prevent unauthorized access to the network by restricting the devices that can be connected to a specific port.

The following are some common techniques used in port security:

- **Broadcast storm prevention**: This technique prevents a broadcast storm from occurring by limiting the number of broadcasts that can be sent on a port.
- **Bridge Protocol Data Unit (BPDU) guard**: This technique prevents loops from occurring in the network by preventing BPDU packets from being received on a port.
- **Loop prevention**: This technique prevents loops from occurring in the network by disabling a port when a loop is detected.
- **Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) snooping**: This technique prevents rogue DHCP servers from being connected to the network by monitoring DHCP messages and dropping any messages that do not originate from a trusted DHCP server.
- **Media access control (MAC) filtering**: This technique restricts the devices that can connect to a port by specifying a list of allowed MAC addresses.

These techniques can be implemented using agent-based or agentless methods, depending on the network environment and the specific requirements of the organization.

## Network appliances

A network appliance **is a device or software application designed to perform a specific network function, such as routing, switching, security, or network monitoring**. It is a hardware or software tool that is placed on a network and provides a specific service or set of services. Some examples of network appliances are routers, switches, firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and load balancers.

Here are some common network appliances:

- **Jump servers**: A jump server is a specialized server that is used to access other servers and devices within a network. It is usually placed in a demilitarized zone (DMZ) or a separate network segment, and administrators use it to securely access other servers and devices without having to expose those devices to the public internet.
- **Proxy servers**: A proxy server is an intermediary server that sits between clients and servers and acts as a gateway for client requests. There are two types of proxy servers: forward proxy servers and reverse proxy servers. Forward proxy servers are used to access the internet on behalf of clients, while reverse proxy servers are used to distribute incoming requests among a group of servers.
- **Network-based intrusion detection system (NIDS)/network-based intrusion prevention system (NIPS)**: NIDS/NIPS are security appliances that monitor network traffic for signs of malicious activity. NIDS/NIPS can use different methods to detect attacks, including signature-based detection, heuristic/behavioral detection, and anomaly detection. NIDS/NIPS can be deployed in inline or passive mode, depending on the level of protection required.
- **HSM**: A hardware security module (HSM) is a specialized cryptographic device that is used to secure sensitive data and cryptographic keys. HSMs can be used to perform cryptographic operations, such as encryption and decryption, and to manage cryptographic keys.
- **Sensors**: Sensors are network devices that are used to collect data on network activity, such as traffic flows, packet payloads, and network events. Sensors can be deployed at different points in the network, such as at the perimeter or in the core, to provide visibility into network activity.
- **Collectors**: Collectors are network devices that are used to aggregate data from multiple sensors or other sources. Collectors can be used to store and analyze network data, and to provide a central point of control for network security.
- **Aggregators**: Aggregators are network devices that are used to combine multiple network connections into a single connection. Aggregators can be used to increase network bandwidth and to provide redundancy and failover protection.

### Firewalls

A firewall **is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security rules**. It acts as a barrier between the internal network and the internet or other external networks to prevent unauthorized access and malicious attacks.

Here are some types of firewalls and their elaboration:

- **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**: It is a type of firewall that specifically targets web application traffic. It inspects HTTP traffic and applies security policies to protect against attacks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
- **Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW)**: It is an advanced type of firewall that combines traditional firewall functionalities with additional features such as intrusion prevention, deep packet inspection, and application-level control. It provides more granular control over network traffic and can identify and block sophisticated threats that traditional firewalls may miss.
- **Stateful Firewall**: It is a type of firewall that keeps track of the state of network connections and only allows traffic that matches an existing connection to pass through. This provides additional security by preventing malicious traffic that is not part of an established connection.
- **Stateless Firewall**: It is a type of firewall that only inspects each individual packet and does not maintain any information about previous packets or network connections. It is less secure than stateful firewalls as it cannot prevent certain types of attacks such as TCP SYN floods and IP address spoofing.
- **Unified Threat Management (UTM)**: It is a type of firewall that integrates multiple security features into a single appliance, such as antivirus, intrusion prevention, VPN, and content filtering. It provides a comprehensive approach to network security.
- **Network Address Translation (NAT) Gateway**: It is a type of firewall that translates private IP addresses to public IP addresses, allowing devices on the internal network to access the internet without revealing their private IP addresses. It also provides an additional layer of security by hiding the internal network topology from the internet.
- **Content/URL Filter**: It is a type of firewall that filters web traffic based on the content or URL of the requested resource. It can block access to websites or web pages that contain inappropriate or malicious content.
- **Open-Source vs. Proprietary**: Firewalls can be either open-source or proprietary. Open-source firewalls are free and can be customized by the user, but may not have the same level of support as proprietary firewalls. Proprietary firewalls are commercial products that provide technical support and often have additional features and capabilities.
- **Hardware vs. Software**: Firewalls can be implemented as hardware devices or software programs. Hardware firewalls are standalone appliances that are installed at the network perimeter and provide dedicated security services. Software firewalls are installed on a server or workstation and protect that device.
- **Appliance vs. Host-based vs. Virtual**: Firewalls can be deployed as physical appliances, installed on a host, or run as a virtual machine. Appliance-based firewalls are standalone devices that are specifically designed for network security. Host-based firewalls are installed on individual computers or servers and protect the host device. Virtual firewalls are software-based and run on a virtual machine.

## Access control list (ACL)

An Access Control List (ACL) **is a security mechanism used in computer networks and operating systems to restrict access to specific resources**. It is a list of rules that controls which network traffic or system resources are allowed or denied to a specific user or group of users.

ACLs can be implemented on various levels, such as at the router or switch level, at the file system level, or at the application level. They are composed of entries that identify a specific user, group, or network, along with a set of permissions or actions that are allowed or denied.

ACLs can be used for a variety of purposes, including restricting access to sensitive data, controlling network traffic flow, and enforcing security policies. They are often used in conjunction with other security measures, such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems, to provide comprehensive network security.

## Route security

Route security **refers to measures taken to protect the routing infrastructure of a network from various types of attacks, including route hijacking, route leaks, and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks**. The routing infrastructure is critical to the proper functioning of a network, as it determines the paths that packets take as they traverse the network. A compromise of the routing infrastructure can result in traffic being redirected or lost, leading to significant disruptions or outages.

To enhance route security, several measures can be taken, including:

1. BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) security: BGP is the protocol used to exchange routing information between different networks on the internet. Enhancing BGP security involves measures such as filtering incoming and outgoing BGP announcements, using BGP origin validation, and implementing BGP route validation.
2. RPKI (Resource Public Key Infrastructure): RPKI is a system that provides a way to cryptographically sign routing information and validate the authenticity of this information. It helps prevent route hijacks and leaks by allowing routers to verify that the origin of a BGP announcement is authorized to advertise a particular prefix.
3. Route filtering: Route filtering involves implementing access control lists (ACLs) and route maps to control the flow of traffic through the network. It helps prevent the spread of malicious traffic and enables the prioritization of legitimate traffic.
4. Route reflectors: Route reflectors are used to simplify the management of BGP in large networks. They are responsible for propagating routing information to other routers in the network. By using route reflectors, a network can reduce the number of BGP sessions required, which can improve scalability and reduce the risk of errors.
5. Route analytics: Route analytics involves using tools to monitor and analyze the routing information flowing through the network. It can help detect anomalies and potential security issues, such as route leaks or hijacks, and enable proactive measures to prevent or mitigate them.

Overall, implementing route security measures can help improve the reliability and security of a network's routing infrastructure, and ensure the proper functioning of critical services and applications.

## Quality of service (QoS)

Quality of Service (QoS) **refers to a set of techniques used to manage network traffic and prioritize certain types of traffic over others**. QoS is used to ensure that critical network traffic is given priority over non-critical traffic.

QoS can be implemented by setting network policies that define the minimum or maximum bandwidth, delay, jitter, and packet loss rates for different types of traffic. QoS can also be implemented by using various queuing mechanisms, such as First-In-First-Out (FIFO), Weighted Fair Queuing (WFQ), and Priority Queuing (PQ), to prioritize traffic flows based on their importance.

## Implications of IPv6

IPv6 is the latest version of the Internet Protocol (IP), designed to replace the current version, IPv4. IPv6 provides several benefits, including an increased address space, better security, and improved performance. However, its implementation can also have several implications:

1. IPv6 addresses are longer than IPv4 addresses, making them more difficult to remember and potentially more vulnerable to typographical errors.
2. IPv6 requires the use of new hardware and software that support the protocol, which can lead to significant costs for organizations that need to upgrade their networks.
3. IPv6 introduces new security risks, such as the potential for attackers to use IPv6 tunnels to bypass security measures and the need for new security mechanisms to protect IPv6 traffic.
4. IPv6 introduces new routing protocols and new features such as automatic address configuration, which can make it more difficult to manage and secure networks.
5. Dual-stack networks, which support both IPv4 and IPv6, can create additional complexity and increase the attack surface of a network.
6. IPv6 may not be backward compatible with older IPv4-based systems and applications, which can cause compatibility issues for organizations that rely on legacy systems.

Overall, the adoption of IPv6 requires careful planning and consideration of the potential implications and risks involved.

## Port spanning/port mirroring

Port spanning or port mirroring **is a feature available on many network switches that allows a network administrator to monitor network traffic by sending a copy of network packets from one port on the switch to another port that has been configured to receive the mirrored traffic**.

Port spanning/mirroring can be useful for network troubleshooting, performance monitoring, and security analysis. For example, a network administrator could configure port spanning/mirroring to send a copy of all traffic from a critical server to a network monitoring tool to detect any suspicious activity or performance issues.

Port taps are a type of network tap that can be used for more advanced network monitoring and analysis. Unlike port spanning/mirroring, which is a software-based feature on a network switch, port taps are hardware devices that physically tap into the network cabling to capture a copy of all traffic flowing through the network. This allows for more accurate and detailed network analysis, as port taps can capture all traffic on the network, including traffic that may not be visible to a network switch due to VLAN segmentation or other network configurations.

## Monitoring services

Network monitoring services **are tools and technologies used to monitor network traffic and activity to identify potential security threats, troubleshoot network issues, and ensure network performance and availability**. These services can include software and hardware solutions that collect and analyze network data, including network traffic, system performance, and security events. Network monitoring services can be used to detect network outages, bandwidth constraints, and security breaches, as well as identify usage patterns and trends to improve network performance and capacity planning. Network monitoring services can also provide real-time alerts and notifications to network administrators, allowing them to quickly respond to security threats and network issues.

## File integrity monitors

File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) **is a security solution designed to detect and alert on any unauthorized or unexpected changes to critical files and directories on a system or network**. FIM compares the current state of files and directories to their baseline or previous state, detecting any changes such as modifications, deletions, or additions. FIM can help organizations detect and prevent unauthorized access, data exfiltration, and data breaches.

FIM typically operates by creating a snapshot of the baseline of the files and directories to be monitored. This baseline is used as a reference point for future changes, with any deviations from the baseline flagged as potentially suspicious. FIM can also generate alerts and notifications to administrators when a change is detected, and in some cases, can even block unauthorized changes or roll back unauthorized changes to the previous state.
