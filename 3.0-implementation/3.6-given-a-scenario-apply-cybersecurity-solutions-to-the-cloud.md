# 3.6 Given a scenario, apply cybersecurity solutions to the cloud

## Cloud security controls

Cloud security controls **are a set of measures and technologies that are implemented to protect cloud-based resources and data from unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security threats**. These controls are designed to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of cloud-based resources and data.

Some cloud security controls are:

- **High availability across zones**: Refers to the ability of a cloud infrastructure to provide redundancy and failover across multiple geographical zones to ensure that applications and services remain available in the event of an outage or failure in one zone.
- **Resource policies**: Refers to a set of rules and permissions that govern access to cloud resources. These policies are used to define who can access resources, what they can do with them, and under what conditions.
- **Secrets management**: Refers to the management and protection of sensitive information such as passwords, API keys, and other cryptographic keys that are used to secure cloud resources. Secrets management tools help ensure that this information is securely stored and accessed only by authorized users and applications.
- **Integration and auditing**: Refers to the integration of cloud security controls with other security systems and tools, such as SIEMs and log management tools. Auditing is the process of monitoring and reviewing security events to ensure that security controls are effective and that security policies are being followed. Cloud providers typically offer tools and services that enable integration and auditing to be performed easily and effectively.

### Storage

Storage **cloud security controls are measures put in place to ensure the security and integrity of data stored in a cloud storage environment**. These controls help to protect the data from unauthorized access, data loss, and data breaches. Some of the important security controls for storage cloud are:

1. **Permissions**: Permissions are the access controls used to manage access to cloud storage resources. It ensures that only authorized users have access to the data, preventing unauthorized access, modification, or deletion of data. Permission controls can be managed using various authentication and authorization mechanisms, such as access keys, policies, and roles.
2. **Encryption**: Encryption is used to protect data stored in the cloud storage from unauthorized access. Data encryption protects data at rest and in transit, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data. Encryption can be implemented using different encryption algorithms and key management systems.
3. **Replication**: Replication ensures that data stored in the cloud storage is not lost in case of any hardware failure or disaster. It provides redundancy and availability of data by replicating data across multiple locations or data centers. Replication helps to prevent data loss due to hardware failure or natural disasters.
4. **High availability**: High availability ensures that data stored in the cloud storage is always available to authorized users. High availability is achieved by using redundant systems, failover mechanisms, and load balancing techniques to ensure that data is always available even in case of system failure or network outage.

Overall, these security controls provide robust protection for data stored in cloud storage, ensuring that it is secure, available, and accessible only to authorized users.

### Network

Network **cloud security controls are measures taken to secure the network infrastructure of cloud computing services**. Some of these controls include:

1. **Virtual networks**: Cloud providers offer the ability to create virtual networks that operate independently of the physical network, enabling customers to segment their network traffic and create network topologies that meet their specific requirements.
2. **Public and private subnets**: Subnets are used to segment the network into smaller, more manageable parts. Public subnets are accessible to the internet, while private subnets are not. This provides an additional layer of security for sensitive data.
3. **Segmentation**: Network segmentation is the practice of dividing a network into smaller, more secure zones. By separating different types of traffic, such as production and development environments, security can be improved.
4. **API inspection and integration**: Cloud providers offer APIs that allow customers to automate the management of their cloud services. However, these APIs also create potential vulnerabilities. By inspecting API traffic and integrating security controls, such as rate limiting and access controls, cloud providers can help protect customers from API-based attacks.

### Compute

Compute **cloud security controls refer to security measures and mechanisms put in place to secure cloud computing resources such as virtual machines, servers, and containers**. Here are some examples of compute cloud security controls:

- **Security groups**: These are virtual firewalls that control inbound and outbound traffic to virtual machines. They allow administrators to specify which ports and protocols are allowed or denied for specific virtual machines.
- **Dynamic resource allocation**: This refers to the ability of cloud computing resources to scale up or down automatically based on demand. This helps to ensure that resources are always available to meet workload requirements.
- **Instance awareness**: This refers to the ability to monitor and manage cloud computing resources such as virtual machines, servers, and containers. Instance awareness allows administrators to monitor resource usage, detect potential threats, and take corrective actions.
- **Virtual private cloud (VPC) endpoint**: This is a secure way to access cloud services over a private network. VPC endpoints allow administrators to access cloud services without exposing them to the public internet.
- **Container security**: Containers are a lightweight alternative to virtual machines that provide isolated environments for running applications. Container security controls include access controls, image scanning, and vulnerability management.

Overall, compute cloud security controls help to protect cloud computing resources from unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security threats.

## Solutions

- **Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB)**: Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB) is a solution that helps organizations monitor and secure their cloud environments by providing visibility into cloud services and the ability to enforce security policies. CASB solutions can provide a range of security controls, including data loss prevention (DLP), access control, encryption, and threat detection.
- **Application security**: Application security in a cloud environment involves securing the software applications that run on cloud infrastructure. This can include security testing, vulnerability management, and secure software development practices. Cloud providers often offer security features for their application services, such as identity and access management (IAM), encryption, and secure network communication.
- **Next-generation secure web gateway (SWG)**: Next-generation secure web gateway (SWG) is a solution that provides security for web traffic, including the ability to inspect and block malicious traffic. SWG solutions can also provide URL filtering and content filtering to enforce acceptable use policies and prevent data leakage.
- **Firewall considerations in a cloud environment**: In a cloud environment, firewalls can be implemented using cloud-native solutions or by using virtual appliances that run on cloud infrastructure. It is important to understand how traffic flows within the cloud environment and to implement segmentation to limit the blast radius in case of a breach. Additionally, organizations should consider the cost of implementing firewalls in a cloud environment and determine the most cost-effective solution for their needs.

## Cloud native controls vs. third-party solutions

Cloud native controls are security solutions that are provided by the cloud service provider themselves. These controls are typically designed to work specifically with the provider's cloud infrastructure, and are integrated into their platform.

Some examples of cloud native controls include:

-   Identity and access management (IAM) tools provided by the cloud provider to manage user access and permissions.
-   Encryption tools that allow you to encrypt data stored on the cloud provider's servers.
-   Network security tools that allow you to create virtual private networks (VPNs) and set up firewall rules to restrict traffic.
-   Monitoring and logging tools that allow you to monitor your cloud environment for suspicious activity.

On the other hand, third-party solutions are security tools that are provided by a vendor that specializes in security solutions. These tools are designed to work across different cloud environments, and can be used to secure your cloud environment regardless of which cloud provider you use.

Some examples of third-party cloud security solutions include:

-   Cloud access security brokers (CASBs), which provide a layer of security between your on-premises infrastructure and your cloud environment.
-   Cloud workload protection platforms (CWPPs), which provide security for workloads running in the cloud.
-   Cloud security posture management (CSPM) solutions, which help you manage your security posture across your cloud environment.
-   Security information and event management (SIEM) solutions, which provide centralized monitoring and analysis of security events across your cloud environment.

Both cloud native controls and third-party solutions have their own advantages and disadvantages. Cloud native controls are often more tightly integrated with the cloud provider's infrastructure, which can make them easier to manage and more cost-effective. However, third-party solutions may offer more advanced features and may be more customizable to your specific needs. Ultimately, the best approach to cloud security will depend on your organization's specific requirements and the cloud services you use.
