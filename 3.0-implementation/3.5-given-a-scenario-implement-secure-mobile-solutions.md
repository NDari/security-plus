## Deployment models

Deployment models **refer to the different ways in which mobile devices are deployed and managed in an organization**. The following are some commonly used deployment models:

- **Bring your own device (BYOD)**: This deployment model allows employees to use their personal mobile devices for work-related purposes. BYOD is often implemented to reduce costs and increase employee productivity by allowing them to work from their preferred devices. However, BYOD brings security challenges, as employees may use devices that are not properly secured or managed, which could expose sensitive corporate data to unauthorized access.
- **Corporate-owned personally enabled (COPE)**: In this model, the company owns and provides mobile devices to employees, but employees are allowed to use them for personal purposes as well. COPE devices are usually managed and secured by the company's IT department, which can install and configure apps, set up policies and restrictions, and monitor and enforce compliance.
- **Choose your own device (CYOD)**: In CYOD deployment model, employees are given a selection of company-approved devices to choose from. This approach provides employees with some level of choice and flexibility, while still enabling IT to manage and secure the devices.
- **Corporate-owned**: This deployment model involves providing employees with company-owned mobile devices that are managed and controlled entirely by the IT department. This model is often used in highly regulated industries or where strict security policies are required.
- **Virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI)**: In this deployment model, mobile devices are used to access virtual desktops or applications hosted on remote servers. The actual computing and data processing take place on the server side, while the mobile device acts as a terminal to display the results. VDI can provide a high level of security, as data is not stored on the mobile device, but rather in the secure data center.

Overall, the deployment model chosen depends on various factors such as the organization's security policies, budget, and user requirements.
