# 3.1 Given a scenario, implement secure protocols

## Protocols

- **Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC**): DNSSEC is a set of extensions to the Domain Name System (DNS) that provide authentication of DNS data, enabling DNS clients to verify the authenticity of the DNS responses they receive.
- **SSH**: Secure Shell (SSH) is a cryptographic network protocol that enables secure communication between two networked devices, typically a client and a server. SSH is commonly used for remote access to servers and other networked devices, allowing users to securely log in and execute commands.
- **Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME)**: S/MIME is a protocol used to secure email communication by providing authentication, integrity, confidentiality, and non-repudiation. It is commonly used in business environments where secure email communication is critical.
- **Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP)**: SRTP is a security extension of the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP), which is used to transmit audio and video over the internet. SRTP provides confidentiality, integrity, and replay protection to RTP packets.
- **Lightweight Directory Access Protocol Over SSL (LDAPS)**: LDAPS is a secure version of the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), which is used to access and manage directory services. LDAPS uses SSL/TLS to provide encryption and authentication for LDAP traffic.
- **File Transfer Protocol, Secure (FTPS**): FTPS is a secure version of the File Transfer Protocol (FTP), which is used to transfer files over the internet. FTPS uses SSL/TLS to provide encryption and authentication for FTP traffic.
- **SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP)**: SFTP is a secure version of the File Transfer Protocol (FTP), which is used to transfer files over the internet. SFTP uses SSH to provide encryption and authentication for file transfer traffic.
- **Simple Network Management Protocol, version 3 (SNMPv3)**: SNMPv3 is a secure version of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), which is used to manage and monitor network devices. SNMPv3 uses encryption and authentication to provide security for SNMP traffic.
- **Hypertext transfer protocol over SSL/TLS (HTTPS)**: HTTPS is a secure version of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), which is used to transmit data over the internet. HTTPS uses SSL/TLS to provide encryption and authentication for HTTP traffic.
- **IPSec**: IPSec is a protocol suite used to provide security for IP traffic. It includes two main protocols, Authentication Header (AH) and Encapsulating Security Payloads (ESP), which provide authentication and confidentiality for IP packets, respectively. IPSec can be used in tunnel or transport mode to protect traffic at the network or transport layer.
- **Post Office Protocol (POP)/Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP)**: POP and IMAP are two protocols used for retrieving email from a server. Both can be secured using SSL/TLS to provide encryption and authentication for email traffic.

## Use cases

-   Voice and video: Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) is commonly used to provide confidentiality, integrity, and authentication to real-time multimedia traffic over IP networks.
-   Time synchronization: Network Time Protocol (NTP) can be secured using NTP authentication and Symmetric Key Cryptography.
-   Email and web: Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) is used to provide end-to-end encryption and digital signatures for email messages. HTTPS, which uses SSL/TLS, is commonly used to secure web traffic, including online transactions and sensitive data transfers.
-   File transfer: File Transfer Protocol, Secure (FTPS) and SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) are commonly used to secure file transfers.
-   Directory services: Lightweight Directory Access Protocol Over SSL (LDAPS) is used to provide secure access to directory services such as Active Directory.
-   Remote access: Secure Shell (SSH) is used for remote login and execution of commands on remote machines. It provides confidentiality, integrity, and authentication for remote access.
-   Domain name resolution: Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) is used to secure domain name resolution by providing data integrity and authentication to DNS queries.
-   Routing and switching: IP Security (IPSec) is commonly used to provide confidentiality, integrity, and authentication to IP traffic, including routing and switching.
-   Network address allocation: Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) can be secured using Secure DHCP, which provides authentication and encryption of DHCP messages.
-   Subscription services: Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS) is used to secure subscription services, including online content delivery and streaming services.
