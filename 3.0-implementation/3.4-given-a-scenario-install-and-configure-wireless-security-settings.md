# 3.4 Given a scenario, install and configure wireless security settings

## Cryptographic protocols

Cryptographic protocols **are sets of rules that are designed to secure communication between two parties over a network**. In the context of wireless security, cryptographic protocols are used to protect the data transmitted between wireless devices and access points.

Some common cryptographic protocols used in wireless security include:

- **WiFi Protected Access 2 (WPA2)**: This is the most widely used protocol for securing wireless networks. It uses the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm to encrypt data transmitted over the wireless network.
- **WiFi Protected Access 3 (WPA3)**: This is the latest version of the WPA protocol and provides stronger security than WPA2. It uses a new key exchange protocol called Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE) to protect against attacks that target the authentication process.
- **Counter-mode/CBC-MAC Protocol (CCMP)**: This is the encryption protocol used in WPA2 and WPA3. It uses AES in counter mode for encryption and CBC-MAC for message authentication.
- **Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE)**: This is a key exchange protocol used in WPA3. It provides stronger protection against attacks that try to steal the password used for authentication.

These cryptographic protocols are designed to provide strong protection against attacks that try to intercept or modify data transmitted over wireless networks. However, it is important to note that the security of wireless networks also depends on other factors such as the strength of passwords, the configuration of network devices, and the physical security of access points.

## Authentication protocols

Authentication protocols **are used to verify the identity of users or devices attempting to connect to a network or access a resource**. Here are some commonly used authentication protocols:

- **Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP**): EAP is an authentication framework used in wireless networks and point-to-point connections. It supports a variety of authentication methods, including password-based, token-based, and certificate-based authentication.
- **Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol (PEAP)**: PEAP is a more secure version of EAP that encrypts the EAP conversation using Transport Layer Security (TLS) or Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption. It provides protection against eavesdropping attacks.
- **EAP-FAST**: EAP-FAST is a faster version of EAP that eliminates the need for digital certificates. It uses a shared secret instead of digital certificates to authenticate users.
- **EAP-TLS**: EAP-TLS is a certificate-based authentication protocol that uses digital certificates to authenticate users. It provides strong security against man-in-the-middle attacks and other types of attacks.
- **EAP-TTLS**: EAP-TTLS is a combination of EAP and Tunneling Protocol (TTLS). It provides authentication and confidentiality for data exchange between clients and servers.
- **IEEE 802.1X**: IEEE 802.1X is a standard for port-based network access control. It provides a mechanism for authenticating devices before allowing them to connect to a network.
- Remote Authentication Dial-in User Service (RADIUS) Federation: RADIUS Federation is a standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between different RADIUS servers. It allows users to authenticate across different domains and networks.

All these authentication protocols help in securing the network by verifying the identity of users or devices before granting access to network resources.

## Methods

Wireless configuration methods **refer to the different ways of configuring a wireless network to allow access to authorized users while preventing unauthorized access**. Some common wireless configuration methods include:

1. **Pre-shared key (PSK)**: This is a common method of securing wireless networks for home and small office use. With PSK, all devices on the network share a common passphrase, and users enter this passphrase to gain access to the network. However, this method is vulnerable to attacks, such as dictionary attacks or brute force attacks, where hackers try to guess the passphrase.
2. **Enterprise**: This method is used in larger organizations and requires a RADIUS server for authentication. Enterprise networks use a digital certificate or username and password to authenticate users.
3. **Open**: With this method, anyone can connect to the wireless network without authentication. Open networks are not secure and should only be used in public places such as cafes or libraries.

Other wireless configuration methods include:

1. **WiFi Protected Setup (WPS)**: This method is used to simplify the process of connecting devices to a wireless network. WPS allows users to connect to the network without entering the SSID or passphrase.
2. **Captive portals**: A captive portal is a web page that users are redirected to when they first connect to a wireless network. Users must enter their credentials, accept terms of use, or pay a fee before they can access the internet. Captive portals are commonly used in public places such as airports or hotels.

It is important to note that the choice of wireless configuration method should be based on the security needs of the organization or individual, as well as the ease of use for the end-users.

## Installation considerations

When planning and installing a wireless network, there are several considerations to take into account to ensure optimal performance and security. Some of these considerations include:

- **Site surveys**: Before installing a wireless network, it is important to conduct a site survey to determine the best locations for access points (APs) and identify any potential sources of interference.
- **Heat maps**: A heat map is a visual representation of the wireless coverage and signal strength in a given area. Heat maps can help identify areas with poor coverage or signal strength and inform the placement of APs.
- **WiFi analyzers**: WiFi analyzers are software tools that can be used to troubleshoot wireless networks, analyze signal strength, and identify potential sources of interference.
- **Channel overlaps**: WiFi networks operate on different channels, and it is important to avoid channel overlaps to minimize interference and maximize performance.
- **Wireless access point (WAP) placement**: Access point placement is critical to ensuring optimal performance and coverage. Access points should be placed in locations where they can provide coverage to the desired areas while avoiding interference from other sources.
- **Controller and access point security**: It is important to secure both the wireless access points and the wireless controller. Access points should be configured with strong passwords, and the controller should be protected from unauthorized access. Additionally, it is important to regularly update the firmware on both the access points and controller to address any known vulnerabilities.
