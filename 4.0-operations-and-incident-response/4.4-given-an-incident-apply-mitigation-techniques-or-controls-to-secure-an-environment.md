# 4.4 Given an incident, apply mitigation techniques or controls to secure an environment

## Reconfigure endpoint security solutions

**Endpoint security solutions are software solutions that protect individual devices (endpoints) from security threats, such as malware, phishing attacks, or unauthorized access**. Reconfiguring endpoint security solutions is one of the key mitigation techniques for securing an environment.

One approach to reconfiguring endpoint security solutions is to create an **application approved list**. This list **includes only the applications that are authorized to run on an endpoint device**. Any attempt to run an application that is not on the approved list will be blocked. This approach reduces the attack surface by restricting the number of applications that can be run on an endpoint device.

Another approach is to create an application **blocklist or deny list**. This list **includes applications that are not allowed to run on an endpoint device**. Any attempt to run an application on the blocklist will be blocked. This approach is useful for preventing the use of known malicious applications or applications that have known vulnerabilities.

**Quarantine** is another important feature of endpoint security solutions. **When an endpoint security solution detects a potentially malicious file or application, it can be automatically quarantined, preventing it from causing harm to the system**. Quarantine also allows security analysts to analyze the file or application and determine if it is a threat to the system.

Overall, reconfiguring endpoint security solutions by implementing an approved list, blocklist, or quarantine feature can help prevent security threats and reduce the attack surface of an environment.

## Configuration changes

Configuration changes **refer to modifications made to the configuration settings of a system or application to enhance its security posture**. Here are some examples of configuration changes for various security solutions:

- **Firewall rules**: Firewall rules can be configured to allow or block specific types of network traffic based on various criteria such as the source and destination IP addresses, ports, and protocols. By reconfiguring firewall rules, organizations can restrict the flow of network traffic and reduce the attack surface of their systems.
- **MDM**: Mobile device management (MDM) solutions can be used to manage and secure mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. By reconfiguring MDM policies, organizations can enforce security controls such as device encryption, password requirements, and remote wipe capabilities to protect sensitive data on mobile devices.
- **DLP**: Data loss prevention (DLP) solutions can be used to prevent sensitive data from leaving an organization's network. By reconfiguring DLP policies, organizations can specify which types of data are considered sensitive and how they should be protected (e.g., encrypted in transit, blocked from being sent outside the network).
- **Content filter/URL filter**: Content filter and URL filter solutions can be used to block access to websites and other online content that could pose a security risk. By reconfiguring these filters, organizations can block access to known malicious websites and prevent employees from visiting non-work-related websites that could be a source of malware or phishing attacks.
- **Update or revoke certificates**: Digital certificates are used to verify the identity of websites, applications, and other digital assets. By updating or revoking certificates, organizations can ensure that only trusted entities are able to access their systems and data. For example, if a certificate is compromised or expires, it should be immediately revoked or replaced with a new one to prevent unauthorized access.

## Isolation

Isolation **is a security technique that involves separating critical systems or data from the rest of the network or other less secure systems to prevent unauthorized access or the spread of malware or other threats**. Isolation can be achieved through various methods, such as physical separation, network segmentation, or virtualization. By isolating systems or data, organizations can reduce the risk of attacks or breaches and limit the impact of any security incidents that occur. Isolation can be implemented in various areas, including network, application, and data. For example, a network can be segmented to isolate sensitive servers or data, or a virtual machine can be created to isolate an application from the rest of the system.

## Containment

Containment **refers to the process of limiting the impact of a security incident or data breach by isolating the affected systems or network segments**. The goal of containment is to prevent the incident from spreading further and to give incident response teams time to investigate and remediate the issue.

Containment may involve various technical and procedural measures, such as disconnecting affected systems from the network, disabling user accounts, suspending certain services or applications, blocking certain IP addresses or ports, and so on. These measures help to minimize the damage caused by the incident and reduce the risk of further compromise.

Containment is an important step in the incident response process and should be implemented as quickly as possible after an incident is detected. This helps to limit the damage and reduce the time and resources required to remediate the issue.

## Segmentation

Segmentation **is a security strategy that involves dividing a network or system into smaller segments, often referred to as subnetworks or subnets, in order to enhance security**. This technique is used to limit the ability of attackers to move laterally through a network, as well as to reduce the impact of security incidents.

Segmentation can be implemented using various technologies such as VLANs, firewalls, and virtual private networks (VPNs). By segmenting a network, an organization can apply different security controls and policies to each segment based on the level of risk associated with the data and systems within that segment. For example, sensitive data can be placed in a highly secured segment while less sensitive data can be placed in a less secure segment. This approach can help reduce the risk of data breaches and other security incidents, as well as limit the scope of any incidents that do occur.

## Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR)

SOAR stands for Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response. It **is a technology solution designed to help security teams automate their incident response workflows and integrate various security tools and technologies to streamline their operations**.

Runbooks and playbooks are two common terms used in SOAR. **A runbook is a set of predefined procedures or steps that a security analyst follows when responding to an incident**. It provides a consistent, repeatable process for managing security incidents. Runbooks can be customized to suit an organization's specific needs and can include specific actions to be taken based on the type and severity of the incident.

**Playbooks**, on the other hand, **are more complex than runbooks and provide a framework for orchestrating the response to a security incident**. Playbooks can include multiple runbooks, as well as automated actions and integrations with other security tools and technologies. They are designed to automate as much of the incident response process as possible and help organizations respond quickly and effectively to security incidents.

In summary, runbooks and playbooks are two essential components of SOAR technology that help security teams to automate and streamline their incident response workflows.
