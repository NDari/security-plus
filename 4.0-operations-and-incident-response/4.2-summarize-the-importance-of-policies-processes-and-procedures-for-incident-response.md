# 4.2 Summarize the importance of policies, processes, and procedures for incident response

## Incident response plans

Incident response plasn **are a set of policies, processes, and procedures that an organization follows in the event of a security incident**. The plan outlines the steps to be taken by the incident response team to contain the incident, minimize damage, and restore normal operations as quickly as possible.

An effective incident response plan is critical for minimizing the impact of security incidents on an organization and for ensuring that the organization can respond quickly and effectively to any incident that does occur.

## Incident response process

The incident response process **is a structured approach that organizations follow to respond to and manage security incidents**. The following are the six elements of the incident response process:

1. **Preparation**: This element involves developing an incident response plan, establishing an incident response team, and defining roles and responsibilities. It also includes identifying the critical assets, creating backups, and establishing communication channels to notify stakeholders in case of an incident.
2. **Identification**: This element involves identifying the security incident, collecting information, and classifying the incident based on its severity and impact.
3. **Containment**: This element involves isolating the affected systems to prevent the incident from spreading. The incident response team works on containing the incident and preventing further damage to the environment.
4. **Eradication**: This element involves removing the root cause of the incident and fixing the affected systems. The incident response team ensures that all the malicious software or other artifacts are removed from the systems.
5. **Recovery**: This element involves restoring the affected systems to their normal state and ensuring that they are functioning correctly. The incident response team performs system tests and verifies that the systems are secure.
6. **Lessons learned**: This element involves analyzing the incident response process, identifying any gaps, and updating the incident response plan. It also involves conducting training sessions to educate the incident response team and stakeholders on the lessons learned.

## Exercises

Incident response exercises **are a simulated scenario or drill that tests an organization's ability to respond to a security incident or breach**. These exercises can help organizations identify gaps in their incident response plans and procedures, improve communication and coordination among incident response teams, and provide hands-on experience for personnel to better prepare them for a real incident. There are various types of incident response exercises, such as tabletop exercises, walkthroughs, and simulations, each with their own level of complexity and objectives. Regular incident response exercises are an important part of a comprehensive incident response program.

1. **Tabletop**: A tabletop exercise is a type of incident response exercise that simulates a cybersecurity incident in a discussion-based format. Participants discuss and analyze the incident response plan and procedures, identify potential gaps, and make recommendations for improvement. The exercise is typically conducted in a non-stressful, classroom-style setting.
2. **Walkthroughs**: A walkthrough is a type of incident response exercise that involves a detailed review of the incident response plan and procedures with key stakeholders. The exercise is focused on identifying potential issues and risks that could arise during a real incident and developing solutions for those issues.
3. **Simulations**: A simulation is a type of incident response exercise that involves a realistic, hands-on scenario in which participants respond to a simulated cybersecurity incident. The exercise is designed to test the incident response plan and procedures, as well as the capabilities and readiness of the incident response team. Simulations are typically more complex and stressful than tabletop exercises and walkthroughs, and may involve the use of realistic tools and equipment.

## Attack frameworks

Attack frameworks **are models or methodologies that describe the different stages of a cyberattack, including the techniques and tools used by attackers at each stage**. They provide a structured approach for understanding and analyzing cyberattacks and can be used to guide incident response activities and develop defensive strategies.

The following are some of the commonly used attack frameworks:

1. **MITRE ATT&CK**: This framework is widely used in the cybersecurity industry to describe the tactics and techniques used by attackers. It is organized into different stages of an attack, from initial access to exfiltration, and includes over 200 techniques and sub-techniques.
2. **The Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis**: This model breaks down an intrusion into four main components: adversary, capability, infrastructure, and victim. It provides a framework for analyzing an intrusion in a structured way and can be used to identify patterns and relationships between different components.
3. **Cyber Kill Chain**: This framework was developed by Lockheed Martin and describes the stages of a cyberattack from the initial reconnaissance phase to the exfiltration of data. It includes seven stages: reconnaissance, weaponization, delivery, exploitation, installation, command and control, and exfiltration.

These frameworks are widely used in the cybersecurity industry and can provide a structured approach to understanding and analyzing cyberattacks, as well as developing effective defensive strategies.

## Stakeholder management

Stakeholder management **is the process of identifying, analyzing, and developing relationships with individuals or groups who have a vested interest in a project, program, or organization**. It involves identifying stakeholders, understanding their needs and expectations, and developing strategies to effectively engage and communicate with them. Stakeholder management helps mitigate risks and avoid conflicts by identifying potential issues early on and developing strategies to address them.

## Communication plan

A communication plan **is a detailed strategy that outlines how information will be shared with various stakeholders during a project, crisis, or other significant event**. The primary purpose of a communication plan is to ensure that relevant information is communicated to the right people at the right time and in the right way. A communication plan typically includes the following elements:

1. Purpose and objectives: This section outlines the goals and objectives of the communication plan and defines the scope of the plan.
2. Target audience: Identifying the stakeholders and determining their communication needs, expectations, and preferences.
3. Key messages: The essential information that needs to be communicated to stakeholders, such as what happened, what the organization is doing about it, and what the impact will be.
4. Channels and tools: This section outlines the different communication channels that will be used to deliver the key messages to the target audience, such as email, social media, press releases, or town hall meetings.
5. Roles and responsibilities: Identifying the individuals or teams responsible for communicating the key messages, monitoring feedback, and responding to questions or concerns.
6. Timeline: A schedule of when and how often the communication will take place, outlining important milestones or deadlines for the delivery of information.
7. Feedback and evaluation: This section describes how the communication plan's effectiveness will be evaluated, and feedback will be collected from stakeholders to improve future communication plans.

Overall, **a communication plan is a vital element of effective incident response and helps organizations to communicate with stakeholders in a coordinated, efficient, and effective manner, building trust and confidence among stakeholders**.

## Disaster recovery plan

A Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP) **is a document that outlines a structured approach to recover and restore critical IT infrastructure and systems that have been disrupted due to a natural or man-made disaster**. The primary objective of a DRP is to minimize the downtime and impact on business operations and to ensure the availability, integrity, and confidentiality of critical data and systems. A disaster recovery plan typically includes procedures for data backup, restoration, and continuity of operations, as well as roles and responsibilities of key personnel during the recovery process. The plan should also consider scenarios for different types of disasters, such as power outages, cyber attacks, and natural disasters, and should be tested regularly to ensure that it is effective in a real-world situation.

## Business continuity plan

A business continuity plan (BCP) is a document that outlines the procedures and processes an organization must follow to ensure that essential business functions continue to operate during and after a disaster or other disruptive event. The goal of a BCP is to minimize the impact of the disruption and to ensure that the organization can quickly resume operations to normal or near-normal levels.

A BCP typically includes the following elements:

1. Business impact analysis (BIA): This is a process that identifies and assesses the potential impact of a disruptive event on the organization's critical business functions and processes.
2. Risk assessment: This is a process that identifies potential risks and vulnerabilities that could impact the organization's ability to continue operations during a disruptive event.
3. Emergency response procedures: This includes procedures for responding to the immediate aftermath of a disruptive event, such as evacuating employees and securing the facility.
4. Recovery procedures: This includes procedures for restoring critical business functions and processes after a disruptive event, such as restoring IT systems and processes.
5. Testing and maintenance procedures: This includes procedures for testing and maintaining the BCP to ensure that it remains effective and up-to-date.

**A BCP is important for all organizations, as it helps them to minimize the impact of a disruptive event on their operations, reputation, and finances**. It also helps to ensure that they can continue to serve their customers and clients, and fulfill their obligations and commitments to stakeholders.

## Continuity of operations planning (COOP)

Continuity of Operations Planning (COOP) **is the process of ensuring that essential functions continue to be performed during and after a catastrophic event or disruption to normal operations**. The goal of COOP is to ensure the timely resumption of critical business functions, maintain essential operations, and minimize the impact of a disruption to the organization's mission, functions, and services. COOP plans are designed to be scalable and flexible to accommodate various types of disruptions, including natural disasters, cyber-attacks, or pandemics. The plans typically include procedures for emergency response, alternate site operations, crisis communication, and recovery and reconstitution.

## Incident response team

An incident response team **is a group of individuals responsible for detecting, investigating, and responding to cybersecurity incidents within an organization**. The team typically consists of professionals with specialized skills in areas such as forensics, malware analysis, network security, and incident management.

The incident response team is responsible for developing and implementing an incident response plan, which includes procedures and policies to identify, contain, eradicate, and recover from security incidents. They work closely with stakeholders within the organization to ensure that business operations are not impacted by security incidents and that the organization can return to normal operations as quickly as possible.

The incident response team should have well-defined roles and responsibilities and be trained on the latest threat intelligence, attack techniques, and incident response best practices. Additionally, the team should conduct regular incident response exercises and review and update the incident response plan to ensure that it remains effective and up-to-date.

## Retention policies

Retention policies **refer to the policies and procedures that an organization has put in place to manage the retention and disposal of its data, documents, and records**. The policies dictate how long the organization must keep data and documents, and when they can be destroyed or disposed of.

Retention policies are designed to ensure that the organization retains the necessary information to meet legal, regulatory, and operational requirements, while disposing of information that is no longer needed. Retention policies should consider factors such as the type of information, the value of the information to the organization, and the legal and regulatory requirements that apply to the information.

Retention policies are an important part of an organization's information management program, as they help to reduce the risks associated with keeping information for too long or disposing of information too soon. By implementing retention policies, organizations can ensure that they are in compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, while reducing the costs and risks associated with storing and managing large volumes of data and documents.
