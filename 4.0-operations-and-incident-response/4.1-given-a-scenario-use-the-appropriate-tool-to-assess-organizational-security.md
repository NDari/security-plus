## Password crackers

Password crackers **are tools or programs that are designed to crack or break passwords that protect a particular resource, such as a computer system, application, or network**. These tools work by attempting to guess the password through brute force methods, dictionary attacks, or other techniques, often using large sets of precomputed hashes. The goal of password cracking is to gain unauthorized access to the protected resource. However, password cracking can also be used by security professionals to assess the strength of passwords and to identify weaknesses in password policies. Popular password cracking tools include John the Ripper, Hashcat, and Hydra.

## Data sanitization

Data sanitization, also known as data wiping, data erasure, or data destruction, **is the process of permanently and securely deleting data from storage media so that it cannot be recovered or reconstructed by any means**. Data sanitization is typically performed on hard drives, solid-state drives, USB drives, tapes, and other types of storage media that contain sensitive or confidential information.

The process of data sanitization typically involves overwriting the data on the storage media with a series of random patterns or characters, making it impossible to recover the original data. There are various methods of data sanitization, including software-based techniques that overwrite the data, hardware-based techniques that physically destroy the storage media, and cryptographic techniques that encrypt the data and then securely delete the encryption keys.

Data sanitization is essential for protecting sensitive or confidential information from unauthorized access or disclosure. It is particularly important when disposing of old or damaged storage media, or when transferring storage media to another party. Many organizations have data sanitization policies and procedures in place to ensure that sensitive information is properly and securely deleted when it is no longer needed.
