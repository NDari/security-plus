# 4.5 Explain the key aspects of digital forensics

## Documentation/evidence

Documentation/evidence **refers to the collection, preservation, and presentation of information to support an investigation or legal case**. It is important to maintain the integrity of evidence throughout the entire investigation process.

Some elaborations on different aspects of documentation/evidence are:

- **Legal hold**: A legal hold refers to the process of preserving evidence for a potential legal case. It involves identifying and securing all relevant data and documents that may be used in the case.
- **Video**: Video evidence may include CCTV footage, body-worn camera footage, or screen recordings. It can be used to provide visual evidence of an incident or to demonstrate a sequence of events.
- **Admissibility**: Admissibility refers to the ability of evidence to be accepted and used in court. Admissibility is based on factors such as relevance, reliability, and authenticity.
- **Chain of custody**: Chain of custody refers to the chronological documentation or paper trail that records the sequence of custody, control, transfer, analysis, and disposition of physical or electronic evidence. It is important to maintain a chain of custody to ensure the integrity of the evidence.
- **Timelines of sequence of events**: Timelines of sequence of events are a graphical representation of a sequence of activities and events. Time stamps and time offsets are important pieces of information that help establish the order of events and the timeline of the incident.
- **Tags**: Tags are metadata that are attached to evidence to describe it and help with organization and retrieval. They can include information such as file type, author, date, and location.
- **Reports**: Reports are a formal documentation of an investigation and include details such as the incident summary, findings, and conclusions. Reports should be detailed and objective.
- **Event logs**: Event logs are records of events that occur on a system, such as login attempts, file access, or network traffic. They can provide valuable information in an investigation.
- **Interviews**: Interviews are conversations with individuals involved in an incident, such as witnesses or suspects. Interviews can provide important context and information about the incident. It is important to document interviews carefully and accurately.

## Acquisition

Acquisition **refers to the process of collecting and preserving digital evidence for further analysis**. It involves gathering data from various sources, such as computer systems, mobile devices, or network infrastructure, in a forensically sound manner to ensure that the data is preserved and not altered during the collection process.

One important principle related tothe acquisition of forensic evidences is the **Order of volatility**. This **is the principle that digital evidence is volatile and can be lost or altered if not collected in a timely manner**. The order of volatility is a guideline for prioritizing the collection of volatile data sources based on how quickly they may change or be lost.

Some sources for acquisition are:

- **Disk**: Disk acquisition involves making a forensic copy of the entire hard drive, including any deleted files and hidden data.
- **Random-access memory (RAM)**: RAM acquisition involves capturing the contents of a computer's memory, including any running programs and system processes. This is important for capturing volatile data that may be lost when the system is shut down.
- **Swap/pagefile**: Swap/pagefile acquisition involves capturing the data that has been swapped out of RAM and written to the hard drive.
- **OS**: Operating system acquisition involves capturing the data and configuration settings of the operating system, including user accounts, installed software, and system logs.
- **Device**: Device acquisition involves capturing data from mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets.
- **Firmware**: Firmware acquisition involves capturing data from the firmware of devices such as routers, switches, and cameras.
- **Snapshot**: Snapshot acquisition involves capturing a point-in-time copy of a virtual machine or storage device.
- **Cache**: Cache acquisition involves capturing data that has been cached by applications or web browsers.
- **Network**: Network acquisition involves capturing data from network traffic, including packet captures and log files.
- **Artifacts**: Artifacts are pieces of data left behind by user activity or system processes. Examples of artifacts include browser history, cookies, and system logs.

Documentation and evidence collection during acquisition is critical and must adhere to best practices to ensure admissibility in court.

## On-premises vs. cloud

Digital forensics can be conducted in both on-premises and cloud environments. However, there are some differences in the approach and challenges involved in each environment.

- **On-Premises Forensics**: In on-premises forensics, the investigation is conducted on physical hardware and storage devices that are located within the organization's premises. The forensic investigator can take physical possession of the devices, which allows for a comprehensive analysis of the system. The data that is collected from these devices can be easily preserved and analyzed.
- **Cloud Forensics**: In cloud forensics, the investigation is conducted on virtual machines, cloud storage, and other cloud-based services. In this environment, forensic investigators may not have direct access to the physical hardware, and the data may be spread across multiple geographic locations. As a result, the forensic investigation may require additional steps to ensure that the data is collected and analyzed correctly.

Some concepts to be famimliar when collecting forensic eveidences are:

- **Right-to-Audit Clauses**: Right-to-audit clauses are contractual provisions that allow a party to conduct an audit of the other party's systems or data. In cloud environments, these clauses can be used to facilitate the forensic investigation by allowing forensic investigators to access the cloud service provider's systems and data.
- **Regulatory/Jurisdiction**: Regulatory and jurisdictional considerations are essential. The laws and regulations governing data collection, storage, and transmission can differ between countries and regions. Forensic investigators must be aware of these differences to ensure that the investigation is conducted legally and ethically.
- **Data Breach Notification Laws**: Data breach notification laws require organizations to notify individuals if their personal data has been compromised in a data breach. In cloud environments, these laws can be more complex due to the distributed nature of the data. Forensic investigators must be aware of the relevant laws and regulations to ensure that notifications are made correctly and in a timely manner.

## Integrity

Integrity **refers to the preservation of the authenticity, accuracy, and completeness of data during an investigation**. It is important to ensure that the data has not been altered, manipulated, or tampered with in any way that could affect its reliability as evidence.

The following are some of the techniques used to maintain the integrity of digital evidence:

- **Hashing**: This is the process of using a cryptographic algorithm to generate a fixed-size digest of data that represents the content of the original data. Any change to the original data will result in a different hash value, making it easy to detect any alteration to the data. Commonly used hashing algorithms include SHA-1, SHA-256, and MD5.
- **Checksums**: A checksum is a simple method of ensuring the integrity of data by adding up the values of all the bytes in the data and comparing the result to a predefined value. If the two values match, it means that the data has not been altered.
- **Provenance**: This refers to the documentation of the origin, custody, and ownership of digital evidence. It is important to track the chain of custody of evidence to ensure that it has not been tampered with or mishandled.

In addition to these techniques, it is important to follow best practices for evidence collection and handling to ensure that the integrity of the evidence is maintained throughout the investigation process. This includes documenting the collection process, using write-protect tools to prevent accidental changes, and storing the evidence in a secure location to prevent unauthorized access.

## Preservation

Preservation **refers to the process of ensuring that the integrity and authenticity of digital evidence are maintained from the time it is collected until it is presented in court**. It involves taking appropriate measures to prevent any alteration, deletion, or modification of the evidence during its handling, storage, and analysis. The goal of preservation is to ensure that the evidence remains usable and admissible in a court of law.

Preservation involves creating a bit-for-bit copy of the original evidence, also known as a forensic image. This forensic image is used for analysis, leaving the original evidence untouched to maintain its integrity. The forensic image is stored in a secure location, using write blockers to prevent any write access to the original evidence.

Preservation also involves documenting the chain of custody to ensure that the evidence is not tampered with while in possession of investigators or other authorized personnel. This involves maintaining a detailed record of who has handled the evidence, where it has been, and what actions were taken with it at each step of the investigation. This documentation is important for demonstrating the integrity and authenticity of the evidence in court.

## E-discovery

E-discovery, or electronic discovery, **refers to the process of locating, preserving, collecting, reviewing, and producing electronically stored information (ESI) in response to a legal or regulatory request or investigation**. ESI can include a wide range of electronic data such as emails, text messages, social media posts, databases, videos, and other digital files. The process of e-discovery involves using specialized tools and techniques to search and analyze the ESI to identify relevant information and to ensure that the data is preserved in a forensically sound manner. E-discovery is an important aspect of modern legal and regulatory compliance, as the vast majority of information is now stored electronically.

## Data recovery

Data recovery **is the process of retrieving data from damaged, failed, or inaccessible storage media such as hard drives, solid-state drives, memory cards, USB drives, and other digital storage devices**. The data recovery process involves using specialized software tools and techniques to extract data from the damaged or corrupted storage media. Data recovery may be necessary due to hardware failure, software malfunction, accidental deletion, virus attacks, or other causes of data loss. The goal of data recovery is to retrieve as much data as possible from the damaged storage media while minimizing the risk of further damage or data loss.

## Non-repudiation

Non-repudiation **is a security concept that ensures that a party cannot deny that they performed a specific action or transaction**. This concept is often used in legal and contractual situations, where it is important to establish proof that a party took a specific action or made a specific statement. Non-repudiation is typically achieved through the use of digital signatures or other cryptographic mechanisms that ensure the integrity and authenticity of electronic documents or communications. By ensuring non-repudiation, parties can have greater confidence in the validity of digital transactions and can more easily resolve disputes that may arise.

## Strategic intelligence/counterintelligence

**Strategic intelligence refers to the collection, analysis, and dissemination of information that is relevant to a particular organization's decision-making processes**. This information is often used to identify and evaluate opportunities and threats in the organization's external environment, including its competitors, customers, and regulatory bodies. Strategic intelligence is used to gain a competitive advantage and make informed business decisions.

**Counterintelligence**, on the other hand, **refers to the efforts made to prevent hostile entities from gathering and collecting intelligence that could harm the organization**. It involves detecting, identifying, and neutralizing foreign intelligence activities that pose a threat to the organization's personnel, facilities, operations, or sensitive information. The goal of counterintelligence is to protect the organization's interests and ensure the security and integrity of its operations.
